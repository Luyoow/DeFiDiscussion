<goobygg> Curve Finance front end is compromised  samczref in #offtopic
<0x7ec> or join us in #general
<eyaleponym> Meaning bundles arrive / pass simulation too late to be included?
<goobygg> I don't check gen chat too often 
<goobygg> Let me hop in there
<vagabond2971> someone should send some tornado eth to the wethusdc uni pool no?
<__reece__> That would be interesting
<0x7ec> it would be a revert? no fallback or receive
<0x7ec> maybe with some extra steps
<ani9040> could tornado in some usdc
<arianonwastaken> nothing a good ol selfdestruct can't solve
<ani9040> or did they already blacklist the tornado addresses?
<arianonwastaken> they did
<bertcmiller> yes
<eyaleponym> Thanks Is there a good way to check for this? The time stamp on the block seems largely irrelevant
<rjected> implementing simple tx exchange w/ akula might not be that hard if u really want to use it
