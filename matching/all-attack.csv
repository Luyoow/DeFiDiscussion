Kyber Network,,"Kyber Network tweeted that KyberSwap Elastic has experienced a security incident. According to the analysis of the SlowMist security team, the root cause of this attack is that in calculating the number of tokens needed for the exchange from the current price to the boundary scale price, the liquidity will be added to the portion of the fee compounding because of KyberSwap Elastic's reinvestment curve, thus causing its calculation result to be larger than expected, which can cover the user's need for exchange, but the actual price has already crossed the boundary scale, which makes the protocol think that the liquidity within the current scale has already met the need for exchange, and therefore does not carry out liquidity update. The protocol assumes that the liquidity within the current scale is sufficient to cover the redemption needs, and therefore does not update the liquidity. The result is that the liquidity is increased twice when the reverse exchange crosses the boundary scale, allowing the attacker to obtain more tokens than expected. On Nov. 27, the Kyber Network tweeted that the KyberSwap team had contacted the owner of the frontrun bots that had withdrawn approximately $5.7 million from the KyberSwap pool on Polygon and Avalanche. After negotiations, the owners of the frontrun bots have agreed to return 90% of their users' funds to a designated address. In return, they will receive a 10% bounty. On December 13th, the KyberSwap team recovered approximately $508,000 worth of  funds from the owners of frontrun bots. To date, the total amount of funds returned by the owners of frontrun bots is approximately $5.17 million.","54,700,000",Liquidity Exploit,2023-11-23,https://twitter.com/KyberNetwork/status/1727475235342217682,,,,,,

Euler Finance,,"The DeFi lending protocol Euler Finance was attacked, and the attackers made a profit of about 197 million US dollars. The attacker used flashloans to deposit funds and then leveraged them twice to trigger the liquidation logic, donating the funds to the reserve address and conducting a self-liquidation to collect any remaining assets. Two key factors contributed to the success of the attack: 1. Funds were donated to the reserved address without being subjected to a liquidity check. This created a mechanism that could directly trigger soft liquidation. 2. When the soft liquidation logic was triggered by high leverage, the yield value increased, enabling the liquidator to obtain most of the collateral funds from the liquidated user's account by transferring only a portion of the liabilities to themselves. Given that the value of the collateral funds exceeded the value of the liabilities (which were only partially transferred due to the soft liquidation), the liquidator was able to successfully pass their health factor check (checkLiquidity) and withdraw the obtained funds.

FEG,,"The multi-chain DeFi protocol FEG was attacked again, and the flash loan attack suffered on the BNB chain lost about $1.3 million in assets. The subsequent flash loan attack on Ethereum caused a loss of about $590,000, with a total loss of about $1.9 million in assets. This attack is similar to yesterday's attack and is caused by a vulnerability in the ""swapToSwap()"" function. This function directly uses the ""path"" entered by the user as a trusted party without screening and validating the incoming parameters. Additionally, the function will allow an unverified ""path"" parameter (address) to use the current contract's assets. Therefore, by calling ""depositInternal()"" and ""swapToSwap()"", the attacker can obtain permission to use the assets of the current contract, thereby stealing the assets within the contract.","1,900,000",Flash Loan Attack,2022-05-17,https://twitter.com/CertiKAlert/status/1526357878503768070,,,,,,

According to SlowMist, the hacker’s initial source of funds was ChangeNOW, and the hacker’s address has interacted with multiple DApps, including Multichain, Venus Protocol, Alpaca Finance, Stargate, Curve, Uniswap, Trader Joe, PancakeSwap, SushiSwap, etc. Analyst @samczsun posted a post explaining how hackers used Binance Bridge to steal BNB. The attackers stole 1 million BNB twice, but both used the height of 110217401, which is much lower than the normal height. Furthermore, the proof submitted by the attacker is shorter than the legitimate proof, showing that the attacker forged the proof for that particular block. The specific method is to add a new leaf node when the COMPUTEHASH function generates a hash, and then create a blank internal node to satisfy the prover, and exit early after finding a matching hash with the internal node. So far, only two fake verifications have been generated in this way.","2,000,000 BNB",Pseudo-authentication,2022-10-06,https://twitter.com/SlowMist_Team/status/1578220472373649408,,,,,,
