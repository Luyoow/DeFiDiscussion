You could include this address and its slots in the access list regardless but that would be costly if the coinbase doesn't match this contract. The solution is straightforward: just use more gas when transferring funds to the coinbase address. By default when using block.coinbase.transfer the fallback will have only 2300 gas available which is not enough to access cold storage if fallback uses it.

I always get the bundle hash but it never actually get included and I am using more than enough fees. This is how I am constructing it:```signer = ...tx1 = { \\'chainId\\': 1 \\'type\\': 2 \\'to\\': \\'0x...\\ \\'value\\': 85879237723674000 \\'gas\\': 21000 \\'maxFeePerGas\\': 6100629634606 \\'maxPriorityFeePerGas\\': 6054020802016 \\'nonce\\': 4}tx2 = { ... } # similar to tx1token_tx = { \\'chainId\\': 1 \\'type\\': 2 \\'to\\': \\'0x...\\ \\'data\\': \\'0x....\\ \\'nonce\\': 4 \\'gas\\': 70000 \\'maxFeePerGas\\': 2680000128 \\'maxPriorityFeePerGas\\': 0}```token_tx[\\'data\\'] is the abiencoded version of something like this:```{ name\": transfer params\": [ { name\": _to value\": 0x... type\": address } { name\": _value value\": 148000000 type\": uint256 } ]}```And finally the bundle:```bundle = [ {\\'signer\\': signer \\'transaction\\': tx1} {\\'signer\\': signer \\'transaction\\': tx2} {\\'signer\\': signer \\'transaction\\': token_tx}]```If some builder can help me I can provide you my bundle hashes.
