[2021-10-30 15:48:14] <0x5f3759df_> Ohhh i know what happened
[2021-10-30 15:48:23] <0x5f3759df_> The uniswap admin phished you
[2021-10-30 15:48:34] <0x5f3759df_> And the mevbot replayed the transaction out of the mempool
[2021-10-30 15:48:37] <0x5f3759df_> And beat them
[2021-10-30 15:51:01] <0x5f3759df_> Hmm actually I don’t think a phisher is that sophisticated to write solidity
[2021-10-30 15:51:29] <0x5f3759df_> Otherwise they wouldn’t be phishing people
[2021-10-30 15:57:44] <0x5f3759df_> You would need to write code to pull it off

[2021-10-30 16:10:02] <0x5f3759df_> Fuck i knew it but i would be surprised the phisher would attack them with code
[2021-10-30 16:10:33] <0x5f3759df_> Like why phish if you can code solidity devs make bank
[2021-10-30 16:12:02] <0x5f3759df_> Did the mevbot combine both transaction and replayed them as 1 single txn?
[2021-10-30 16:12:40] <0x5f3759df_> How would the Uniswap volunteers know the burn contract is bugged?
[2021-10-30 16:14:19] <hiko2022> They helped us cancel the liquidity pool.
[2021-10-30 16:14:27] <Rezan> @Crypto_Rachel mind to give explanations ?
[2021-10-30 16:15:06] <0x5f3759df_> Lol imagine phishing in the flashbots channel and not using flashbots
[2021-10-30 16:17:19] <hiko2022> I hope someone will help me get 39eth back. I will provide him with the guarantee of 400eth's contract.
[2021-10-30 16:17:55] <optimizooor> is it bad if I help the guy recover his money by paying him a finder's fee on his 400eth contract 
[2021-10-30 16:21:00] <0x5f3759df_> Don’t do it. Let me take care of it
[2021-10-30 16:21:02] <0x5f3759df_> Lol
[2021-10-30 16:22:28] <0x5f3759df_> @HIko how did the uniswap admin try to phish you
[2021-10-30 16:22:37] <0x5f3759df_> Did they literally ask you to be a LP

[2021-10-30 16:40:32] <hiko2022> They provided the mailbox.

[2021-10-30 16:51:00] <Deleted> ok just do it
[2021-10-30 16:53:03] <chair> Yes 0xa57 has a history of returning money in these situations where they frontrun a hack
[2021-10-30 16:53:34] <chair> Good chance you will get the money back if you explain very clearly
[2021-10-30 16:54:16] <Deleted> 0xa57 has &gt; 100M usd so maybe they don't need your 38 ETH
[2021-10-30 17:00:51] <Deleted> 5.6 eth went to Ethermine that won't be returned
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-10-30 16:05:24] <Rezan> If this is true I'm pretty sure someone from this chat found and rug the 400 ETH already 
[2021-10-30 16:09:11] <Deleted> two transactions in the same block interacting with MCN frontrunned by the mev bot
[2021-10-30 16:11:29] <hiko2022> Was I deceived by uniswap volunteers?
[2021-10-30 16:12:02] <Deleted> yes but the hacker was hacked
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-10-30 16:33:50] <hiko2022> Are we close to the truth?
[2021-10-30 16:34:55] <Deleted> the hack was supposed to be a rescue with 20% fee? why didn't she use private transaction?
[2021-10-30 16:37:27] <hiko2022> There is so much doubt here
[2021-10-30 16:39:26] <hiko2022> I hope there are some people here who know them and can help us get back what belongs to us.

[2021-10-30 16:55:18] <hiko2022> But they are too busy. 39 eth is a huge sum of money to me all my life.

[2021-10-30 18:27:39] <chair> Tried to help but got frontrun I guess
[2021-10-30 18:28:25] <ripostex> Pretty sure 0xa57 will return but these smaller pools are probably lost
[2021-10-30 18:28:30] <ripostex> Which one of you did it?!
[2021-10-30 18:37:18] <hiko2022> Really?
[2021-10-30 18:40:34] <ripostex> Really on which part? I've seen 0xa57 return funds before. I expect the smaller pools are being drained by someone who saw the discussion in this discord and is looking to make a quick buck.
[2021-10-30 18:42:45] <hiko2022> I think they may charge a fee if they don't give a free refund.

[2021-10-30 17:02:36] <Stayaway> Hello everybody! Please tell me how I can send a bundle of two transactions using web3.py . Maybe I misunderstand the logic of flashbots. a single transaction goes away easily but with a very large fee. I thought I would save on fee if I send a reward to miners with the second transaction but I keep getting the error HTTPError: 400 Client Error: Bad Request for url: https://relay .flashbots.net / Here is the code of transactions maybe someone here has already had such a problem. By the way I am sanding TX to uniswap router. #1st TX tx1 = contract.functions.swapExactETHForTokens(2 # minOut[weth token] # pathACCOUNT_TO # recieverint(deadline))nonce = w3.eth.get_transaction_count(ACCOUNT_FROM.address)tx1 = tx1.buildTransaction({'from': ACCOUNT_FROM.address,'value': w3.toWei('0.00025 ether'),'nonce': nonce,'gasPrice': w3.toWei('150 gwei'),'gas': 500000,})#2nd TX tx2 = {'to': router.address,'value': bribe,'nonce': nonce + 1,'gasPrice': w3.toWei('0 gwei'),'gas': 21000}

[2021-10-30 21:08:32] <dogemus> I've got a question about eth2.0. So when the merge will be done and gas prices will be much lower the mainnet will turn into sht just like polygon(in terms of arbitrage)? I mean the key to success will be to spam as many transactions as possible and spawn 127 nodes around the world. Is this true?
[2021-10-30 22:50:30] <dogemus> thx
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-10-30 22:04:38] <breeze.dev> the block was uncled too coincidentally
[2021-10-30 22:36:38] <breeze.dev> no
[2021-10-30 22:47:14] <thal0x> I don’t think the merge will happen and all of a sudden fees will plummet there’s more to it
[2021-10-30 23:01:08] <breeze.dev> yup same has made me more curious as to their origins

[2021-10-30 23:05:25] <0x5f3759df_> Why do you think she's legit?
[2021-10-30 23:07:17] <ripostex> Asked for proof of ownership rather than just exploiting. Also has a metric fuckton of money already
[2021-10-30 23:09:46] <0x5f3759df_> How would she even find the dude? Like it's so bizarre she would help him instead of exploiting him
[2021-10-30 23:10:24] <ripostex> I'm guessing he asked for help somewhere?
[2021-10-30 23:16:52] <0x5f3759df_> Look at the comments on etherscan
[2021-10-30 23:30:27] <Deleted> it has a lot of money and only used to transfer tokens
[2021-10-31 00:25:32] <Deleted> its a bug of that token you can burn tokens in the uniswap pool to make it more valuable
[2021-10-31 01:07:23] <crypto_rachel> @Deleted User@chairHi everyone So yes as you have ascertained I did try to help bobostoo. I help in uniswap and the user came in stating that there was a bug in the contract and needed to pull the LQ. I looked at the contract and yes as you saw the burn function was left external and unprotected with no msg.sender. After Verifying that the user was the owner of the token. I did try to pull and I was hurrying after seeing the open function knowing a blackhat could do and it would be lost. Unfortunately i've never used or setup scripts for flashbots So I did unexpectedly get beat by that mev bot as you saw . It is very embarrassing and I feel shity. Wish I hadn't even seen it tbh. And just fyi I don't have a contract with 400eth I had told the user that I've helped recover over 400eth the money did go through a dex so that wallet is not mine most likely the dexs wallet. I'm curious how one uses that email from the bot? Do you need an account with riseup It was rejected by my email.
[2021-10-31 01:17:17] <heathclifflover> dude fantom makes me so angry and yet i cant stop trying to work with it. i need advice though because theres like ten bots that really run all the shit
[2021-10-31 01:20:15] <breeze.dev> should have been known that such a transaction being sent to mempool would be exposed for all but I digress
[2021-10-31 01:21:50] <breeze.dev> I've never had that problem personally so can't speak to that
[2021-10-31 01:22:06] <breeze.dev> sorry I should of quoted
[2021-10-31 01:22:59] <heathclifflover> yeah this seems to be the case but in my testing it also doesnt seem to be a big difference i think they theyre just plugged in to validators since they can run them from the early profit they made
[2021-10-31 01:23:02] <crypto_rachel> yeah 
[2021-10-31 01:23:24] <breeze.dev> minor dealings @Crypto_Rachel

[2021-10-31 01:24:09] <breeze.dev> no one is dead or sick everyone has all their body parts as far as i know
[2021-10-31 01:24:17] <breeze.dev> just an imaginary number has changed 
[2021-10-31 01:24:19] <breeze.dev> no big deal we elevate
[2021-10-31 01:24:34] <crypto_rachel> yeah just feel bad and dumber than ever 
[2021-10-31 01:24:49] <crypto_rachel> I should have known better
[2021-10-31 01:25:17] <0x5f3759df_> i'm pretty sure we've all lost money from mev bots
[2021-10-31 01:25:20] <0x5f3759df_> part of the game
[2021-10-31 01:25:26] <crypto_rachel> tru tru
[2021-10-31 01:25:54] <0x5f3759df_> What does LQ mean?
[2021-10-31 01:26:01] <crypto_rachel> liquidity
[2021-10-31 01:26:02] <breeze.dev> liq
[2021-10-31 01:26:18] <breeze.dev> well dont be surprised if you get a partial or full refund
[2021-10-31 01:26:28] <breeze.dev> hopefully someone notices
[2021-10-31 01:26:54] <crypto_rachel> well as of now just don't know what to do
[2021-10-31 01:27:09] <breeze.dev> do what you would do if it never happened
[2021-10-31 01:27:21] <breeze.dev> why anything else? dust it off Rachel

[2021-10-31 01:28:04] <crypto_rachel>  that does help. It really all was with best of intentions truly
[2021-10-31 01:29:02] <crypto_rachel>  Now to learn from the experience
[2021-10-31 01:30:53] <crypto_rachel> oof really. I didn't see website (details) didn't see a whole lot with the pool. And knowing that this burn function was a huge risk I moved faster than I should have
[2021-10-31 02:47:37] <crypto_rachel> yeah we live we learn. the best part if you learn you keep growing
[2021-10-31 03:41:33] <crypto_rachel> oh wow really I super appreciate that. Yeah I meant to learn how to do this  but I always worried and normally have no reason
[2021-10-31 03:46:17] <crypto_rachel> Would I still want to do the block.coinbase.transfer (or bribe with gas priority)?
[2021-10-31 03:49:40] <crypto_rachel> that's really cool  
[2021-10-31 03:50:06] <crypto_rachel> sometimes I feel like I'm in the woods always late to the game 
[2021-10-31 03:50:23] <crypto_rachel> was late to crypto too

[2021-10-31 04:04:31] <ether_trader> Is there an updated list of all the exploits/heists that get mentioned in this discord? It's hard to keep track these days
[2021-10-31 05:22:49] <hiko2022> I'm sorry. This is a misunderstanding.
[2021-10-31 05:27:15] <crypto_rachel> I understand

[2021-10-31 02:37:53] <chair> Don't worry it was nice of you to help. We've all been frontrun before don't stress about it. We're literally a discord of frontrunners so we happen to be more conscious of the possibility.Not sure about the email thing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-10-31 03:40:11] <Rezan> @Crypto_Rachel thanks for the explanation. Next time simply plug this RPC into your metamask to avoid frontrunning: https://ethermine.org/privaterpc
[2021-10-31 03:40:37] <Rezan> Simpler and cheaper than making bundles

[2021-10-31 13:36:17] <hiko2022> No my family is really difficult and our country is also very poor.
[2021-10-31 13:37:03] <hiko2022> I am trying to learn this skill.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-10-31 11:58:56] <chris2_2_2> If your a very talented developer we’re always hiring and pay a lot more than 500 a month 
[2021-10-31 13:20:08] <chris2_2_2> You’d have to be a go dev or next js
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-10-31 13:55:59] <wujase> just wondering is this the right channel when you got scammed?
[2021-10-31 13:56:08] <wujase> i just got scammed and asked help from metamask
[2021-10-31 13:56:16] <wujase> they asked me to fill in the google form
[2021-10-31 13:56:22] <wujase> and brought me in here
[2021-10-31 13:57:02] <epheph> @wujase be careful especially of anyone reaching out to you in private. we've seen lots of people get rescammed.
[2021-10-31 13:58:59] <wujase> yes.. of course. moment i put on my problem on tele they all asking my seed phrase…
[2021-10-31 14:01:09] <wujase> my problem actually when i installed metamask on my samsung galaxy tab log into my wallet then i went to meso it asked me to join “matic network” automatically from my metamask so i pressed… within 5 minutes i have lost 3.500 dollar worth (well with chrrent value of tshare it would ve 4.500 easily)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-10-31 14:21:45] <_qiuyue> Chinese dev's average salary is far more than 500$ per month
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-10-31 14:49:54] <Deleted> I don't like his lies. The picture is from a gzdaily news talking about COVID19. And the MCN token I am not sure whether it is a scam token.
[2021-10-31 14:50:43] <_qiuyue> yeah
[2021-10-31 14:50:51] <_qiuyue> I doubt he is the owner or what
[2021-10-31 14:50:58] <_qiuyue> but the lie is bad
[2021-10-31 14:51:47] <Deleted> $500 salary may be not a lie though if he wrote the burn() bug 
[2021-10-31 14:56:46] <Deleted> I think the developer just copied some code from github and mistakenly removed the auth modifier
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-10-31 16:51:25] <hiko2022> We are a legitimate company and have been operating for more than a year.
[2021-10-31 16:51:53] <hiko2022> Do you think we are meme tokens that have only appeared for a few months?
[2021-10-31 16:57:06] <.burck> If you need your contract audited before your next launch just shoot a message.
[2021-10-31 16:59:47] <hiko2022> Yes we will find more audit companies to audit.
[2021-10-31 17:00:53] <hiko2022> Why do you say our token is a fraud? are you responsible for what you said?
[2021-10-31 17:58:12] <Deleted> https://news.dayoo.com/gzrbrmt/202002/17/158552_53130605.htm
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-10-31 16:54:28] <sipox11> Anybody knows why that tx[0] got on top of the FB bundles if it isn't marked as an eden slot[0] tenant?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-10-31 17:35:04] <rpw> If I send two separate bundles targeting the same block and each bundle includes a single transaction signed by the same wallet are one of the bundles guaranteed to fail from an invalid nonce error?
[2021-10-31 17:58:10] <Deleted> 1. you sent a fake picture saying your father is in ICU? It's a lie. 2. $500/month salary in China? It's a lie. Too many lies
[2021-10-31 17:58:11] <rpw> Thanks @joe mama is there a way to get both txs submitted to the same block without sending them in the same bundle? Or is that the only way? Could I manually change the nonce of the tx in the second bundle or is there no way of knowing how bundles will be ordered in a particular block?
[2021-10-31 17:59:00] <Deleted> This is the source of your father \'s photo

[2021-10-31 18:00:17] <sipox11> Use two different EOAs
[2021-10-31 18:01:05] <rpw> Yeah i thought of that I just need a certain amount of ETH sitting in each wallet so was hoping i could avoid it haha might just settle with this though
[2021-10-31 18:01:19] <Deleted> some people was still buying MCN and got sandwiched
[2021-10-31 18:07:34] <hiko2022> Before that we have made an announcement in advance in the community and I don't think it is people in our community who are buying tokens.
[2021-10-31 18:33:38] <optimizooor> post a link to that because yday I checked both your twitter and your telegram and there was no announcement
[2021-10-31 18:35:50] <optimizooor> if there's a refund I think it should be to a uniswap liquidity pair of a redeployed token (w/out bug) dropped to the liquidity providers before the hack
[2021-10-31 18:38:47] <Deleted> 80 token holders in total. I don't think it is hard
[2021-10-31 18:46:24] <hiko2022> You're right. I can't remember what I did after losing liquidity. I'll reissue the announcement.
[2021-10-31 18:52:25] <hiko2022> I admit that I did something irrational after the loss of liquidity.
[2021-10-31 18:54:26] <hiko2022> Now I should calm down and deal with something.
[2021-10-31 20:33:33] <ripostex> Scammer got paid: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x82c9714b579cf1729ed3e250de35fffa874d8dba1e7d226e1327fef157fbc576/advanced
[2021-10-31 20:33:55] <ripostex> I'm guessing the real contract owner got hacked 32 days ago: https://etherscan.io/address/0xc25acc335e7c259ceb9e3ce23eab671d88a4b6ff
[2021-10-31 20:34:09] <ripostex> The .07 Eth transfer out basically drains the account
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-10-31 18:34:39] <optimizooor> it looks like you were trying to take the uniswap liquidity out of your dead token to yourself tbh
[2021-10-31 18:46:33] <hiko2022> https://twitter.com/Multichannel_/status/1454761012691968000
[2021-10-31 18:51:17] <hiko2022> Before the accident we had provided stable liquidity for a whole year and people were free to buy and sell mcntoken.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-10-31 20:57:33] <optimizooor> @Riposte i’m not following this
[2021-10-31 20:57:41] <optimizooor> which scammer are you talking about
[2021-10-31 20:58:03] <ripostex> @HIko throwing off scammer vibes
[2021-10-31 20:59:29] <optimizooor> and he cashed out to binance already wtf
[2021-10-31 20:59:38] <optimizooor> so much for liquidity providers
[2021-10-31 20:59:51] <optimizooor> https://etherscan.io/tx/0x80071738c6e42034bb74ee46372972e0e1f3c5558e29e69af599f0f98388e22d
[2021-10-31 21:02:09] <optimizooor> and the circle is complete
[2021-10-31 21:02:18] <ripostex> Gross
[2021-10-31 21:02:31] <ripostex> Damn it a57!
[2021-10-31 21:04:03] <optimizooor> this is after the refund before he cashed out to binance
[2021-10-31 21:05:17] <optimizooor> why would he even bother maybe there's some hope
[2021-10-31 21:05:56] <ripostex> For his grandpa maybe 
[2021-10-31 21:07:30] <optimizooor> it can't end like this wtf
[2021-10-31 21:07:52] <optimizooor> a lot more respect for the guys behind the whitehat form that's for sure
[2021-10-31 21:08:16] <ripostex> #bundlealerts shows tx[0] was also a bundle
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-10-31 21:34:32] <hiko2022> hi
[2021-10-31 21:34:32] <hiko2022> We have this contract all the time. Why do we say that this contract has been invaded?
[2021-10-31 21:34:33] <hiko2022> Can hackers transfer ownership of Twitter and telegrams?
[2021-10-31 21:34:34] <hiko2022> https://twitter.com/Multichannel_
[2021-10-31 21:35:29] <hiko2022> We've been working with dextool for years and he can identify me.
[2021-10-31 21:38:27] <hiko2022> Some people here must be a joke.
[2021-10-31 21:38:27] <hiko2022> @Riposte @.
[2021-10-31 21:40:22] <hiko2022> It's your job to blame people here?
[2021-10-31 21:41:38] <hiko2022> Why don't you post this picture? our Twitter can be accessed normally. You are too bad. I will ask the administrator to ban you.
[2021-10-31 21:46:12] <hiko2022> @Riposte I hope you are responsible for what you said your improper accusations.
[2021-10-31 21:47:28] <hiko2022> @. You are angry that you didn't get this 400eth contract.
[2021-10-31 21:47:40] <hiko2022> lol
[2021-10-31 21:53:29] <_ieatbabies_> Not too sure what's going on here but I wouldn't take it personally. Everyone is a suspect when it comes to a large amount of money. No one really knows who you are over discord @HIko
[2021-10-31 21:54:33] <hiko2022> My Twitter visit is normal but some people are doing strange things here.
[2021-10-31 21:55:17] <hiko2022> I transferred the refunded funds to binance because I have done double security certification. I think security is the most important now.
[2021-10-31 21:56:23] <hiko2022> I'm sure you must be a beginner. You don't even understand what this means lol.
[2021-10-31 21:57:09] <hiko2022> Thank you very much because a lot of people know me so I have to clarify something.
[2021-10-31 21:59:46] <_ieatbabies_> Lol you are a penguin with a blue crown to me. I know nothing about you except what I am reading. I've never met you. Not trusting is the default position. It's not an actual reflection of your character
[2021-10-31 21:59:57] <heathclifflover> This from mr GitHub copypasta
[2021-10-31 22:00:45] <heathclifflover> I don’t even straight up copy arb bots on GitHub becuause they always have something fucky. Let alone deploy an entire protocol or token lol
[2021-10-31 22:02:16] <hiko2022> Do I need to provide proof of payment for the developer of this contract? I hired someone else.
[2021-10-31 22:03:14] <cheekybastard_dev> Do you have access control for that are you a beginner burn or can anyone use it?
[2021-10-31 22:03:29] <ripostex> I agree you could be legit but there's a lot of red flags.Pro scammer:  hospital picture of your sick grandpa. C'mon.  repeated mentions of how little you make (despite launching a token with $100K+ in liquidity and being in crypto for at least a year)  some weird shit about having posted message about the hack and then being like Oops I forgot Owner account inactive until recently first new transaction drained the account Refund money immediately sent to exchange. This never happens for real protocols hacked funds always stay onchain.Con scammer: Still engaging after payout Own multiple identity sources (owner account twitter)
[2021-10-31 22:03:47] <optimizooor> Since you want to play it like that
[2021-10-31 22:04:10] <optimizooor> why did you immediately cash out to Binance after being refunded?
[2021-10-31 22:04:36] <Deleted> just deploy your new token and pool and airdrop tokens to your 80 token holders. that will prove everything.
[2021-10-31 22:06:17] <optimizooor> Yeah except that’s not the contract with the faulty burn function in it is it?
[2021-10-31 22:06:35] <hiko2022> yes
[2021-10-31 22:10:11] <hiko2022> Besides our TUSD liquidity pool is stolen.
[2021-10-31 22:10:48] <hiko2022> Why did you put a fake picture and tell people that my Twitter account is inaccessible?
[2021-10-31 22:11:06] <Deleted> when will you deploy your new token? It seems not much work. you can just fix the burn() function and deploy it now. The 80 holders can be even hardcoded into contract constructor
[2021-10-31 22:12:00] <hiko2022> I will contact a reliable developer to do it.
[2021-10-31 22:13:05] <optimizooor> did your token’s website just go offline?
[2021-10-31 22:13:13] <hiko2022> At present the largest holder is our staking pool.
[2021-10-31 22:13:35] <ripostex> @HIko Mind explaining the fake father picture? Reverse image search my man: https://news.dayoo.com/gzrbrmt/202002/17/158552_53130605.htm
[2021-10-31 22:14:13] <optimizooor> Explain this too while your at it
[2021-10-31 22:15:09] <optimizooor> Also you were on Twitter with 12k+ followers can’t find your profile anymore care to link to it?
[2021-10-31 22:15:11] <hiko2022> Do I need to provide you with the expiration date of my server?
[2021-10-31 22:15:45] <hiko2022> https://twitter.com/Multichannel_
[2021-10-31 22:15:48] <Deleted> you should transfer the 32 ETH back to your account and keep it trackable
[2021-10-31 22:16:21] <Deleted> before you deploy your new contract don't touch the money
[2021-10-31 22:20:19] <Deleted> If you fail to do that you are telling everyboy not to help anyone like you anymore. Believe me you may need help again sometime in the future.
[2021-10-31 22:21:41] <hiko2022> I agree with you
[2021-10-31 22:23:15] <hiko2022> We have submitted a great deal of evidence to 0xa57 including proof of our previous work. Things are not as simple as they think. They are not fools.
[2021-10-31 22:24:05] <Deleted> talk is cheap just show me the money
[2021-10-31 22:24:38] <hiko2022> Why don't you develop a better mevbot when you think you are smarter than them?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-10-31 22:56:15] <breeze.dev> deep
[2021-10-31 22:56:30] <breeze.dev> `let me sign that for you`
[2021-11-01 00:50:42] <0x5f3759df_> ohm Lol
[2021-11-01 00:50:59] <0x5f3759df_> they made a metaswap clone called range swap
[2021-11-01 00:51:14] <0x5f3759df_> it's literally a 1:1 swap that ignores pricing for stable swaps
[2021-11-01 00:51:38] <0x5f3759df_> as long as the system has a reserve of liquidity in the pool
[2021-11-01 00:51:55] <nathanworsley> A forced 1:1 swap? That sounds extremely dangerous
[2021-11-01 00:52:16] <0x5f3759df_> yes
[2021-11-01 00:52:17] <0x5f3759df_> https://twitter.com/ohmzeus/status/1452765658232590342
[2021-11-01 00:52:24] <nathanworsley> If there's a dip in the price of one asset in the real world you can just empty the other side of the pool
[2021-11-01 00:52:54] <0x5f3759df_> ohm is a successful ponzi so they are bringing their ponzinomics to other protocols
[2021-11-01 00:53:07] <0x5f3759df_> it's kinda genius game theory tbh
[2021-11-01 00:53:37] <nathanworsley> Ponzis are the new economic model which will revolutionise financial systems and bring freedom to the people
[2021-11-01 00:53:44] <0x5f3759df_> yes
[2021-11-01 00:53:59] <0x5f3759df_> to be fair the US gov has a similar ponzinomic model
[2021-11-01 00:55:48] <nathanworsley> In the scale of human history I don't think the US empire will even last as long as the Roman empire did
[2021-11-01 00:56:49] <nathanworsley> At this point on the timeline the Roman empire was still in early growth whereas US economic power is already waning and other countries are closing the gap
[2021-11-01 00:58:00] <nathanworsley> Lets hope a meritocratic and libertarian economic system built with maths and based on the principles of sovereign autonomy replaces it rather than some Falloutstyle hellscape
[2021-11-01 00:58:14] <0x5f3759df_> i don't think anyone wants to go to war
[2021-11-01 00:58:35] <nathanworsley> I'm not a conspiracy theorist suggesting there will be world wars
[2021-11-01 00:58:42] <0x5f3759df_> i don't know anything about history but now we have the technology to launch nukes from orbit so things are spooky
[2021-11-01 00:58:53] <nathanworsley> Just a gradual economic decline and a transition of global influence towards other superpowers
[2021-11-01 00:59:15] <0x5f3759df_> hmm i think the plan is to relocate to the stronger countries
[2021-11-01 00:59:21] <0x5f3759df_> no point to be married to a failing one
[2021-11-01 00:59:37] <nathanworsley> I'm planning to be dead a long time before any of this becomes a problem
[2021-11-01 00:59:51] <nathanworsley> But it would be nice to create a world worth living in for my descendents
[2021-11-01 01:00:04] <0x5f3759df_> i think we will have good anti aging drugs in the next 2030 years
[2021-11-01 01:00:15] <0x5f3759df_> so lifespan will be over 120yr
[2021-11-01 01:00:19] <0x5f3759df_> maybe longer
[2021-11-01 01:00:22] <nathanworsley> That's what they've been saying every generation all the way back to ancient China
[2021-11-01 01:00:30] <nathanworsley> Immortality is always around the corner
[2021-11-01 01:00:43] <0x5f3759df_> i have a friend that takes metaformin fasts anti androgens
[2021-11-01 01:00:55] <0x5f3759df_> he's like 35 and looks like a literal child at 16yr old
[2021-11-01 01:01:00] <0x5f3759df_> so im really bullish on them
[2021-11-01 01:01:07] <nathanworsley> I'm in my early thirties but look way older
[2021-11-01 01:01:18] <nathanworsley> I'm banking everything on some kind of technological revolution
[2021-11-01 01:01:33] <0x5f3759df_> i have a 2 friends that banked their stem cells with foreverlabs
[2021-11-01 01:01:38] <nathanworsley> They should have a faces of MEV because it would probably rival faces of Meth
[2021-11-01 01:01:43] <0x5f3759df_> i think 5k for 100 years
[2021-11-01 01:02:27] <nathanworsley> There's always the option of freezing yourself
[2021-11-01 01:02:37] <nathanworsley> An ambulance ride into the future
[2021-11-01 01:03:01] <nathanworsley> Unlikely to work but seems like the only thing without a completely 0 probability of success
[2021-11-01 01:03:33] <nathanworsley> Certainly beats having to do all that depressing exercise and healthy eating which only prolongs the inevitable
[2021-11-01 01:05:54] <nathanworsley> Man I just wanted to achieve faster convergence on the Curve stableswap formula and now I have to face down another midday existential crisis
[2021-11-01 01:06:49] <blockypete> MEV psyops at work
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-10-31 23:21:24] <ether_trader> Does flashbots bundle explorer have an API?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-10-31 23:44:57] <nathanworsley> Has anyone managed to achieve better convergence for Curve than their own internal algorithm?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-01 01:33:07] <vagabond2971> it's always around the corner
[2021-11-01 01:33:16] <vagabond2971> until it's actually around the corner
[2021-11-01 01:37:01] <breeze.dev> death is not the end
[2021-11-01 01:40:14] <amanusk> Your bots will keep on running.. until the breaking hardfork 
[2021-11-01 01:46:40] <breeze.dev> I feel personally attacked
[2021-11-01 01:50:10] <chris2_2_2> There’s also doing a brain scan and hoping someone programs you into a clone body or machine in the future
[2021-11-01 01:51:14] <nathanworsley> While all this MEV stuff is fun I'm not sure I'd be humanities first priority to clone and bring back from the dead
[2021-11-01 01:51:59] <breeze.dev> death is a process to being born we aren't finished being birthed yet believe it or not
[2021-11-01 01:52:03] <chris2_2_2> Need to launch your own meme coin
[2021-11-01 01:52:32] <ripostex> Memorize your MEV account passwords. Someone'll want to bring you back once Eth hits $100K 
[2021-11-01 01:52:43] <chris2_2_2> This is actually not a bad idea
[2021-11-01 01:52:46] <chris2_2_2> Offer a huge bounty
[2021-11-01 01:52:51] <chris2_2_2> Wow that’s genius
[2021-11-01 01:53:00] <chris2_2_2> Nathan let’s do a company together that does this
[2021-11-01 01:53:11] <chris2_2_2> People offer crypto bounties for life extension or revival
[2021-11-01 01:53:15] <breeze.dev> lol what
[2021-11-01 01:53:18] <nathanworsley> A company that memorises account passwords for people? Count me in!
[2021-11-01 01:53:21] <chris2_2_2> We can profit off the interest on balances
[2021-11-01 01:53:33] <chris2_2_2> And acts as a lawyer so we release the funds upon success
[2021-11-01 01:53:55] <nathanworsley> It's a cool idea financially incentivise people to keep you alive
[2021-11-01 01:53:59] <chris2_2_2> Yep
[2021-11-01 01:54:00] <breeze.dev> what if the next place after death is great beyond imagination
[2021-11-01 01:54:04] <breeze.dev> but you had a contract to be brought back
[2021-11-01 01:54:07] <chris2_2_2> Lol
[2021-11-01 01:54:10] <chris2_2_2> That would suck?
[2021-11-01 01:54:10] <nathanworsley> Like the opposite of an assassination market
[2021-11-01 01:54:14] <chris2_2_2> Haha yes
[2021-11-01 01:54:23] <chris2_2_2> I mean if your frozen the “company” is supposed@to bring you back
[2021-11-01 01:54:36] <chris2_2_2> But offering huge incentives for outside people to do so would be great
[2021-11-01 01:54:42] <nathanworsley> Kind of risky to get frozen with a portfolio of shitcoins
[2021-11-01 01:54:50] <chris2_2_2> We look at mev paid not gas
[2021-11-01 01:55:03] <chris2_2_2> Lol
[2021-11-01 01:55:05] <breeze.dev> could be a lot of factors really are you using a random signing key?
[2021-11-01 01:55:08] <chris2_2_2> Bullish for btc/eth
[2021-11-01 01:55:11] <ripostex> Wait what?!
[2021-11-01 01:55:16] <chris2_2_2> Gas is fixed
[2021-11-01 01:55:19] <ripostex> You guys have your own algo?
[2021-11-01 01:55:23] <breeze.dev> we probably get a catastrophic downspiral in the markets tomorrow
[2021-11-01 01:55:27] <chris2_2_2> So of course we look at highest coinbase for being added to blocks….
[2021-11-01 01:55:38] <chris2_2_2> I assume since I didn’t write the algo
[2021-11-01 01:55:54] <co3603> Yes but if the gas price is high I guess the coinbase difference is high as well right ?
[2021-11-01 01:56:02] <co3603> nope my own key
[2021-11-01 01:56:04] <chris2_2_2> It goes to tips then right?
[2021-11-01 01:56:06] <chris2_2_2> Not mev
[2021-11-01 01:56:12] <chris2_2_2> Not sure I’m not a submitter 
[2021-11-01 01:56:43] <ripostex> Still confused. Do you follow the mevgeth algo which is based off of effective gas price or do you look at raw eth gained and ignore gas entirely?
[2021-11-01 01:56:46] <breeze.dev> competing with other parties? do you get the same results if just sending eth to another address no contract execs?
[2021-11-01 01:56:56] <chris2_2_2> Miners don’t get gas anymore
[2021-11-01 01:56:59] <breeze.dev> with the amount of eth floating out there who cares to be precise
[2021-11-01 01:57:03] <breeze.dev> smash a few formulas together voila
[2021-11-01 01:57:06] <chris2_2_2> So logically we’d look at total eth gained when simulating blocks
[2021-11-01 01:57:16] <ripostex> Not what mev geth does
[2021-11-01 01:57:30] <chris2_2_2> We’re not running mev geth but it should be pretty similar
[2021-11-01 01:57:34] <chris2_2_2> Give us more eth get in
[2021-11-01 01:57:51] <chris2_2_2> We just don’t support mega bundles yet
[2021-11-01 01:57:56] <ripostex> Should specify yes total Eth when comparing blocks but not when comparing bundles
[2021-11-01 01:58:07] <co3603> Didn't try but I check there is no mev with the same token transfered on those blocks so for me there is no competition?
[2021-11-01 01:58:42] <chris2_2_2> We simulate all blocks then pick most profitable one
[2021-11-01 01:58:46] <breeze.dev> could just be bad luck i.e. you got in too late and the block after flexpool wasnt a flashbottable block either (or the miner bribe wasnt enough in rare cases)
[2021-11-01 01:58:49] <chris2_2_2> To my knowledge that’s how it works
[2021-11-01 01:59:06] <ripostex> OK sounds like the usual mev geth algo then
[2021-11-01 01:59:46] <co3603> it didn't get mined during two blocks. My current result is 11 tx go through on 15 tx
[2021-11-01 02:00:02] <co3603> so 4 tx on 15 that are not mined
[2021-11-01 02:00:27] <breeze.dev> its hard to say what it could be until you eliminate possibilities yourself first
[2021-11-01 02:01:04] <breeze.dev> try using a random key since you arent (and if you were using a random id say stop using it) try sending without contract executions try raising miner bribe try it till its exhausted and come back
[2021-11-01 02:01:26] <co3603>  thanks
[2021-11-01 02:06:45] <chris2_2_2> Also remember most pools especially us are worldwide
[2021-11-01 02:07:01] <chris2_2_2> Obviously from us east to our node in Hong Kong or australia will take a while for you to reach
[2021-11-01 02:07:29] <chris2_2_2> If you check etherscan we usually say which regions node propagated the block
[2021-11-01 02:11:38] <breeze.dev> I'm just speculating based on the DXY
[2021-11-01 02:13:10] <vagabond2971> oh the equity market? yeah it could use some cooling down..
[2021-11-01 02:13:45] <breeze.dev> cancel it with the same nonce but raise gas over 10%
[2021-11-01 02:13:57] <breeze.dev> cant use a lower max priority fee than the original tx either if using eip1559 I think but dont quote me
[2021-11-01 02:15:29] <nftcookiemonster> look this is the hash
[2021-11-01 02:15:40] <nftcookiemonster> nonce 61
[2021-11-01 02:16:27] <crypto_rachel> with MM you need to make sure both base tx fee and Priority are higher than that tx
[2021-11-01 02:27:15] <ripostex> Oof found a worse one: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xafdbd1d24283b1cccad9bcbda19ef9605d35e7d666ae7c22c1830c2cad300e59
[2021-11-01 02:36:18] <vagabond2971> the problem is they use etherscan as their UI
[2021-11-01 02:37:21] <vagabond2971> only 10k profit
[2021-11-01 02:37:35] <bertcmiller> Hmm
[2021-11-01 02:37:36] <ripostex> 1:1 swaps except for USDC which has less decimals
[2021-11-01 02:37:39] <ripostex> wheee
[2021-11-01 02:37:41] <bertcmiller> Yeah
[2021-11-01 02:37:45] <bertcmiller> Yikes
[2021-11-01 02:37:51] <ripostex> DM'd the guy on Twitter
[2021-11-01 02:37:54] <ripostex> don't know what else to do
[2021-11-01 02:37:54] <Sisyphus> lmfao uh
[2021-11-01 02:38:06] <ripostex> no USDC in contract currently
[2021-11-01 02:38:08] <bertcmiller> I’ll try to get it to Zeus
[2021-11-01 02:38:38] <ripostex> Try praying 
[2021-11-01 02:49:43] <firehawk8099> Interesting that a57 is finding and exploiting these smart contract bugs. The ACLfree burn function in MCN above and now RangePool's decimals bug
[2021-11-01 02:50:11] <ripostex> He isn't he's letting others do all the work 
[2021-11-01 02:51:22] <firehawk8099> thought it could be some formal verification methods applied to new smart contracts
[2021-11-01 02:53:06] <ripostex> lemme see if i can find the original
[2021-11-01 02:53:20] <vagabond2971> I mean it's not a contract bug. it's a user error
[2021-11-01 02:54:07] <firehawk8099> for RangePool I thought it was an issue with a 1:1 swap without taking into account that USDC has fewer decimals
[2021-11-01 02:55:02] <ripostex> It's a contract bug
[2021-11-01 02:55:38] <ripostex> Tada: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9123cdcf2b08c6cadb8605996000388792d7b896a8d473a5966ff837a4cbc076
[2021-11-01 02:55:56] <ripostex> Couple blocks later
[2021-11-01 02:56:18] <vagabond2971> you are right. it's a contract bug because of the 1:1 swap
[2021-11-01 02:58:26] <ripostex> That's a nice piece of frontrunning  0xa57's tx is more complicated as he had to first fetch LUSD
[2021-11-01 03:02:12] <ripostex> Oof looks like the mempool tex was the RangePool creator guess they realized their mistake 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-01 01:49:16] <chris2_2_2> Combine Russian taxes and hatred of debt/borrowing with american freedom 
[2021-11-01 01:50:20] <chris2_2_2> Though that’s more reproduction than continuation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-01 01:54:32] <co3603> Hi ! I am sending a MEV bundle with one tx. I put a gas price very high and still my transaction sometimes is not choosen by the miner (Flexpool) ... is there anything specific with this pool ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-01 02:10:54] <vagabond2971> please elaborate 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-01 02:12:42] <nftcookiemonster> hello i really need some expert advice here please help me. how do i speed up or cancel transaction if the metamask was reset. i dont have activity or nothing.
[2021-11-01 02:13:25] <nftcookiemonster> when i try to cancel it with the same nonce the transaction fails
[2021-11-01 02:15:21] <nftcookiemonster> i keep getting error
[2021-11-01 02:15:30] <nftcookiemonster> 0xd6b6c5dd8b33aa77093215db9c9b242e178a26a25f597fe15cb3f52b33853b9a
[2021-11-01 02:17:05] <vagabond2971> paste your error msg here
[2021-11-01 02:17:43] <vagabond2971> yeah your gas price is not enough
[2021-11-01 02:17:59] <vagabond2971> this
[2021-11-01 02:19:45] <nftcookiemonster> 0xd6b6c5dd8b33aa77093215db9c9b242e178a26a25f597fe15cb3f52b33853b9a
[2021-11-01 02:19:51] <nftcookiemonster> dropped and replaced
[2021-11-01 02:19:54] <nftcookiemonster> was it fixed?
[2021-11-01 02:20:45] <crypto_rachel> looks like it
[2021-11-01 02:21:54] <breeze.dev> yup
[2021-11-01 02:24:28] <ripostex> Lol someone forgot about decimals: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xbb4a5ec409b1bf1e258df7f5adf3bab6bdc48fd7a0aa6bc9ff1c6aeda2113815
[2021-11-01 02:26:22] <nftcookiemonster> thank you!! i asked so many discords and nobody had answers. this is easy work for you guys
[2021-11-01 02:29:48] <nftcookiemonster> so what if i wanted the transaction to just cancel without making the new one complete the transaction what would be the steps there?
[2021-11-01 02:33:18] <ripostex> send 0 Eth to yourself with same nonce and higher gas price. It's the cheapest possible way to cancel
[2021-11-01 02:34:04] <0x5f3759df_> alpha leak
[2021-11-01 02:34:35] <0x5f3759df_> damn is this protocol dead on arrival
[2021-11-01 02:36:31] <vagabond2971> hire a frontend engineer ffs
[2021-11-01 02:36:52] <bertcmiller> Uhhh
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-01 02:36:17] <Sisyphus> Oh no
[2021-11-01 02:37:00] <bertcmiller> Is this what I think it is?
[2021-11-01 02:49:29] <0xreid> wait what
[2021-11-01 02:50:45] <firehawk8099> ah this is generalized front running?
[2021-11-01 02:55:57] <firehawk8099> well done sir thanks!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-01 03:44:23] <agking10> Does eip1559 make it so that you have to pay gas for failed transactions now?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-01 03:46:42] <bertcmiller> was the parallel drop botted this time
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-01 05:17:24] <oba> nope it was all NA folks that got in
[2021-11-01 05:17:34] <oba> + people who were lucky enough to get oneclick check on the captcha
[2021-11-01 05:17:45] <oba> none of my non NA friends got it all of my NA friends + I got in
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-01 05:34:20] <Dionysus> hey does mev tx sender income account for what the signer spent on gas?
[2021-11-01 05:35:23] <Dionysus> holy shit somebody just arbed 250k
[2021-11-01 05:35:24] <Dionysus> https://etherscan.io/tx/0xbac6f0df1feb1fa1043df48cb0e0024615638727fb97202c4a9ad4223bdcbd4b
[2021-11-01 05:40:54] <curiousrabbit> thats a sandwich (also not 250k profit)
[2021-11-01 05:41:39] <Dionysus> damn i just took the explorers word
[2021-11-01 05:41:43] <Dionysus> mb
[2021-11-01 05:41:57] <curiousrabbit> nah it's a specific type of sandwiching that can look like a massive arb lol
[2021-11-01 05:42:32] <Dionysus> interesting
[2021-11-01 05:46:15] <Dionysus> so how is it not 250k profit?
[2021-11-01 05:46:20] <curiousrabbit> check two txns above
[2021-11-01 05:46:27] <Dionysus> will do
[2021-11-01 05:49:23] <Dionysus> lol the comment section on the contract
[2021-11-01 05:49:36] <Dionysus> people really don't seam to like that guy
[2021-11-01 05:49:41] <Dionysus> or gal
[2021-11-01 05:49:55] <breeze.dev> hes the scapegoat
[2021-11-01 05:52:12] <Dionysus> lol
[2021-11-01 05:53:05] <Dionysus> i was looking at the uniswap pair contract for a second there lol
[2021-11-01 05:54:17] <heathclifflover> Lol just found good old Yolochain freshly deployed on fantom
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-01 06:21:05] <bertcmiller> that's a throwback
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-01 08:53:20] <Deleted> any link?
[2021-11-01 08:53:40] <heathclifflover> https://ftmscan.com/token/0x8718e8850d351e76a35ec94335ae89fb3b9778e7
[2021-11-01 08:53:56] <heathclifflover> wish i could say i just stumbles into it haha
[2021-11-01 08:56:34] <Deleted> were you attacked?
[2021-11-01 08:57:04] <heathclifflover> lol more like i attacked myself
[2021-11-01 09:01:20] <lukex> what's the issue with YoloChain?
[2021-11-01 09:10:54] <heathclifflover> its an old exploit that someones deploying on other chains.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-01 10:14:21] <0x5f3759df_> what's the exploit?
[2021-11-01 10:14:35] <0x5f3759df_> are we bull or bear on ftm boys?
[2021-11-01 10:14:47] <0x5f3759df_> i feel like solana will beat eth 2.0 and other chains or L2s
[2021-11-01 10:15:44] <Deleted> any mev on solana?
[2021-11-01 10:18:35] <0x5f3759df_> it's possible but much tighter
[2021-11-01 10:18:42] <0x5f3759df_> 400ms blocktime with proof of history
[2021-11-01 10:32:25] <thogard> I like ftm
[2021-11-01 10:32:29] <thogard> I own a bag
[2021-11-01 10:32:42] <thogard> The transactions are ordered sequentially though
[2021-11-01 10:33:15] <thogard> And each protocol runs their own node
[2021-11-01 10:34:19] <ripostex> This is new: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xbff6b4b4695f353362868ad24169b21bb5f0e5b9649600e3e80cffb6aaabde74
[2021-11-01 10:34:25] <ripostex> Gas fees? Coinbase transfer? Why not both!
[2021-11-01 10:36:58] <vagabond2971> what's wrong with it?
[2021-11-01 10:37:29] <ripostex> Just odd that their bribe is split between coinbase and gas fees
[2021-11-01 10:37:43] <ripostex> Haven't really seen that before
[2021-11-01 10:38:20] <ripostex> Also my effective gas price was higher. FB is really annoying sometimes ...
[2021-11-01 10:38:55] <vagabond2971> looks like a hard coded gas limit
[2021-11-01 10:39:14] <Deleted> pay via coinbase but make sure to include a high gas price for the added uncle risk
[2021-11-01 10:39:58] <ripostex> adrenaline junky need some risk to feel alive
[2021-11-01 10:40:13] <Deleted> my guess is that they think that it somewhat hides high payment %s
[2021-11-01 10:40:20] <Deleted> (it doesn't)
[2021-11-01 10:41:52] <ripostex> Oops I lied calculated using their gas limit not gas used. They were a tiny bit better than me.
[2021-11-01 10:45:42] <heathclifflover> It emits a successful transfer but if you aren’t the owner you only receive a tenth of your tokens
[2021-11-01 10:46:00] <heathclifflover> Tbh if you have like any protection it shouldn’t be a problem
[2021-11-01 11:04:34] <heathclifflover> yeah it appears that way mostly cause ftmscan aint the best
[2021-11-01 11:05:16] <heathclifflover> but if you were to say find a person or contract that interacted with it particularly an eoa youd see it that the amounts dont actually match upw
[2021-11-01 11:09:18] <Deleted> yes 0x941ed attacked
[2021-11-01 11:10:16] <Deleted> 0xd0f6 too
[2021-11-01 11:34:42] <Deleted> It's funny 3 bot contracts backrunned it successfully but 2 EOA was trapped.
[2021-11-01 11:36:50] <Deleted> That means most mev bots won't be trapped
[2021-11-01 12:33:12] <Deleted> is this the original creator of YOLO token?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-01 11:04:11] <Deleted> as far as I can see the YOLO token has been successfully backrunned 5 times I din't find any failed arb
[2021-11-01 11:29:30] <Deleted> only small loss 60FTM + 8 FTM it's ok
[2021-11-01 11:30:51] <heathclifflover> Yeah just funny to see
[2021-11-01 11:31:33] <heathclifflover> The dudes that made it is in this chat but I haven’t extracted nearly enough mev to ping him
[2021-11-01 12:23:04] <heathclifflover> That dudes deployed a couple scam tokens like that
[2021-11-01 16:35:40] <breeze.dev> the level of `searching @Riposte does leads me to believe I'm not doing enough 
[2021-11-01 16:35:47] <breeze.dev> learned so much from your messages these past few weeks
[2021-11-01 16:36:57] <breeze.dev> you should toy with mevinspect and report back
[2021-11-01 17:01:10] <SiegeRhino> Yeah Riposte legit has a full node hosted in his brain
[2021-11-01 17:04:07] <Deleted> archive node maybe?
[2021-11-01 17:04:49] <SiegeRhino> Like there is a trigger in his logic that either pays through coinbase or gas price depending on the situation and somehow it managed to activate both at the same time
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-01 14:38:08] <sipox11> Thanks @Riposte I wonder why eden explorer didn't tag it. I guess the guy beat me on speed then
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-01 16:08:10] <Hex> Hello all i would like to build an arb bot but i'm not sure is it a good way to go? I'm kinda new on this MEV stuff i have advanced coding skills on many programming languages and intermediate knowledge of Solidity. I'm listening your advices. Is there any boilerplate for arb bot to develop on? I have checked simplearbitrage on github but i don't think it is a good start or any other strategies?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-01 17:04:12] <SiegeRhino> Prob just a coding error
[2021-11-01 18:37:03] <sipox11> The whole bundle 2 eth transfers should be fine afaik
[2021-11-01 19:14:29] <sipox11> Not 2 ETH transfer two transfers of any amount of ETH I meant 21k gas each
[2021-11-01 20:04:19] <breeze.dev> I know you but you don't know me 
[2021-11-01 20:04:29] <breeze.dev> not surprised to catch you in here either salute
[2021-11-01 20:07:07] <breeze.dev> what's the word on squid games?
[2021-11-01 20:07:24] <breeze.dev> catastrophic
[2021-11-01 20:21:59] <breeze.dev> a bit off topic but some might find this entertaining https://twitter.com/imBagsy/status/1455143081033048068
[2021-11-01 20:24:15] <breeze.dev> checking into it now I\'m curious to see if it was a hacking
[2021-11-01 20:48:12] <breeze.dev> no not at all I mean that in good faith
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-01 17:46:14] <Rezan> There is something unclear in FB docs. It says `bundles below 42,000 gas used are rejected by the relay` but also `Transactions under 42,000 gas such as simple ether transfers are rejected by the Flashbots relay` Is it the whole bundle that has to be &gt; 42k gas or each individual tx in the bundle ?
[2021-11-01 17:47:47] <Rezan> This is close source relay code I think. Can't check.
[2021-11-01 19:10:35] <Rezan> Lol wdym 2 ETH transfer ?
[2021-11-01 19:40:52] <Rezan> Ho ok makes sense thanks!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-01 20:23:55] <Psycho> how tf does that even happen?
[2021-11-01 20:31:30] <Rezan> Should I worry ? any hints ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-01 20:54:01] <ether_trader> Ya'll need to start tweeting some alpha again. Everyone just bragging about their millions now
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-01 21:13:09] <bertcmiller> I noticed the games that @SiegeRhino | Flat is justice was up to
[2021-11-01 21:13:16] <bertcmiller> Should I ruin his alpha
[2021-11-01 21:15:15] <SiegeRhino> Shit who told you LOL
[2021-11-01 21:15:28] <SiegeRhino> Am I getting turned into a twitter thread soon ?
[2021-11-01 21:17:59] <SiegeRhino> Someone already tried now he's on my side 
[2021-11-01 21:21:02] <bertcmiller> You’ve got two choices @SiegeRhino | Flat is justice
[2021-11-01 21:21:20] <bertcmiller> Play by the rules or don’t and I tweet it out
[2021-11-01 21:29:33] <ripostex> Technically he is playing by the rules ...
[2021-11-01 21:32:11] <SiegeRhino> Didn't make the rules
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-01 21:35:44] <anarz> It is not fair. Just find a technical solution but don't leak it.
[2021-11-01 21:37:11] <ripostex> Perfectly fair to leak everything's public in MEV world
[2021-11-01 21:37:52] <bertcmiller> We have a technical solution already
[2021-11-01 21:38:02] <anarz> Not from the flashbots team they can see things that we cant with the relay logs

[2021-11-01 22:46:37] <breeze.dev> damnit
[2021-11-01 22:47:22] <layz391> was remembering you when i posted. although i think I missed the end of the convo as well 
[2021-11-01 22:48:34] <thal0x> I said to myself I should screenshot this....nah I\'m sure it\'s nothing and now I want that damn screenshot
[2021-11-01 22:53:35] <breeze.dev> I see how it feels I alttabbed into that gif
[2021-11-01 23:03:08] <breeze.dev> if someone does find something public they won't even share the public finding 9 times out of 10 including you that's why no one replied
[2021-11-01 23:03:17] <breeze.dev> you can def. build on the repo though its not bad (and new members report profiting with it with no tweak)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-01 22:57:34] <Hex> anyone? :/
[2021-11-01 23:02:24] <breeze.dev> hey this space is cut throat and very competitive to be honest
[2021-11-01 23:02:34] <breeze.dev> not much is out publically besides the flashbots arb repo
[2021-11-01 23:03:22] <thal0x> Just pay close attention to conversations on here and you'll learn a lot
[2021-11-01 23:06:56] <breeze.dev> alpha leak
[2021-11-01 23:07:08] <breeze.dev> paste your wallet addresses into here and check how much free money you might be dropped 
[2021-11-01 23:07:21] <breeze.dev> don\'t dismiss it you may genuinly be shocked
[2021-11-01 23:07:28] <breeze.dev> https://earni.fi/
[2021-11-01 23:07:54] <breeze.dev> if you get an animated shadowey super coder NFT and want to sell it dm me
[2021-11-01 23:10:59] <vagabond2971> how does it work? why do I have to give it my address? does it sell my info lol
[2021-11-01 23:12:21] <breeze.dev> not 100% sure but I think with event logs and a script
[2021-11-01 23:12:35] <breeze.dev> your address is just used to see what air drops might be available on that address
[2021-11-01 23:12:55] <breeze.dev> doesnt even have to be your address you can paste a friends and see if they have any claimable air drops
[2021-11-01 23:13:46] <curiousrabbit> lmao
[2021-11-01 23:13:52] <curiousrabbit> well that explains why you haven't stopped
[2021-11-01 23:14:22] <vagabond2971> ok here we go gonna use my friend a57's address
[2021-11-01 23:15:32] <breeze.dev> his inst airdrop expired (he likely had more we cant see)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-01 23:38:22] <heathclifflover> just regular super coder airdrops for me is it worth it to pay the 100 bucks to mint on these guys? I have an opensea account because i signed up when the degen craze began and tried to sell nfts of my lizard
[2021-11-01 23:38:39] <heathclifflover> noone wanted them 
[2021-11-01 23:40:55] <breeze.dev> wouldn't pay the 100 gas to mint but the perks are worth it imo
[2021-11-01 23:45:21] <_ieatbabies_> I kinda wanna see some lizard pics 
[2021-11-02 00:08:54] <heathclifflover> This ones on the house
[2021-11-02 00:09:54] <heathclifflover> for .1 eth ill record a video of all my lizards eating blueberries
[2021-11-02 00:28:52] <heathclifflover> Lol tbh that’s financial aid money for college but I just had to do it
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-02 00:19:00] <breeze.dev>  you know you extract mev when you use paper money as animal bedding
[2021-11-02 00:29:36] <0xsmartcontract> This punk transaction has flashbots But  i thing only test https://twitter.com/cryptopunksbot/status/1455193592453074954?t=h_2ZvdefMv3a6JUS9__L7A&amp;s=19
[2021-11-02 02:03:50] <breeze.dev> its true the lizards do run shit
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-02 01:06:12] <_ieatbabies_> Lolll lizard bro knows how to make bank 
[2021-11-02 02:17:39] <_ieatbabies_> Why would you sell it?
[2021-11-02 02:19:28] <ether_trader> But do you sell the backend too?
[2021-11-02 02:26:11] <Deleted> secured lmao
[2021-11-02 02:27:34] <breeze.dev> anyone else find it hard to believe that eth costs more this year than bitcoin did last year
[2021-11-02 02:28:44] <breeze.dev> https://tenor.com/view/coachlookupwhatstaringupgif11441676
[2021-11-02 02:31:43] <_grimac> As long as you don;t get you wallet account hacked. It is pretty safe
[2021-11-02 02:34:01] <Deleted> what addr is yours
[2021-11-02 02:35:16] <_grimac> 0xb2bbfd73971279a457514325f209eb63a0341ef2
[2021-11-02 02:36:03] <breeze.dev> oh man
[2021-11-02 02:37:15] <_grimac> I am willing to give you some bucks..just for finding something 
[2021-11-02 02:37:57] <breeze.dev> i decompiled the bytecode but it already was
[2021-11-02 02:38:15] <breeze.dev> https://tenor.com/view/someonehereangelacrypttvtrinmillerscaredgif18778784
[2021-11-02 02:52:10] <chris2_2_2> A 50% increase is easily doable
[2021-11-02 02:52:57] <vagabond2971> except that would not lower the gas price
[2021-11-02 02:53:09] <vagabond2971> will just be more usage
[2021-11-02 02:53:28] <chris2_2_2> Not 50% more at this high priority gas though
[2021-11-02 02:55:54] <chris2_2_2> And even if traffic increases 11 thats 10x more network activity meaning a lot more mev chances and eth burned boosting eth price/demand
[2021-11-02 02:56:17] <vagabond2971> I think we need to look at the total number of nodes. right now it's only about 3k. if you make the block 10x bigger that number is going to drop dramatically
[2021-11-02 02:56:35] <chris2_2_2> But block producing nodes are less than 500 I think
[2021-11-02 02:56:55] <chris2_2_2> And all major players are on hardware capable of 10x I believe
[2021-11-02 02:57:09] <chris2_2_2> Exchanges aren’t on a rpi
[2021-11-02 02:57:31] <vagabond2971> yeah I think that's the route solana is taking with gpus and all that
[2021-11-02 02:58:03] <vagabond2971> but this can be eth's edge actually
[2021-11-02 02:59:08] <chris2_2_2> If blocks went up 10x
[2021-11-02 02:59:24] <chris2_2_2> All defi coin competitors and even l2 coins would see their demand and value drop dramatically
[2021-11-02 02:59:35] <chris2_2_2> And eth price would skyrocket 24x at a minimum
[2021-11-02 02:59:43] <chris2_2_2> That’s my guess
[2021-11-02 02:59:52] <chris2_2_2> Would not be a good time to hold matic lol
[2021-11-02 03:01:47] <vagabond2971> that's probably what's gonna happen. however 10x is not enough for scaling and L2 is still required. so why not keep blocks small to have more decentralization
[2021-11-02 03:02:01] <chris2_2_2> To kill competitors
[2021-11-02 03:02:31] <chris2_2_2> And eth development war chest goes up 10x in value means more developers and faster development of things I assume
[2021-11-02 03:02:49] <vagabond2971> I don't think eth as a community really cares about competitors honestly lol
[2021-11-02 03:02:56] <vagabond2971> I could be wrong tho
[2021-11-02 03:03:06] <chris2_2_2> As mev searchers don’t you want gas super low and betwork activity super high
[2021-11-02 03:03:17] <chris2_2_2> Would increase mev opportunities hugely
[2021-11-02 03:03:27] <chris2_2_2> Also helps get more defi on chain
[2021-11-02 03:04:19] <vagabond2971> yes short term. but I also want to have mev in 10 years and not monopolized by hedge funds
[2021-11-02 03:05:13] <chris2_2_2> I mean eth pos is basically just 5 big players aka exchanges
[2021-11-02 03:05:24] <chris2_2_2> Bigger blocks won’t change that
[2021-11-02 03:05:46] <vagabond2971> that's true. I haven't thought much about pos
[2021-11-02 03:06:10] <vagabond2971> @chris2_2_2 what's you guys plan for pos?
[2021-11-02 03:06:15] <chris2_2_2> Not sure
[2021-11-02 03:06:25] <chris2_2_2> Maybe a pos pool but Canadian laws don’t make it too easy
[2021-11-02 03:07:24] <chris2_2_2> I’m not sure if pos will be more@or less decentralized
[2021-11-02 03:07:40] <chris2_2_2> Given that almost every validator will be in an aws datacentre 
[2021-11-02 03:08:16] <chris2_2_2> There really needs to be an incentive for people to run one at home instead of encouragement for everyone to do it through an exchange
[2021-11-02 03:08:48] <vagabond2971> with slashing is kinda hard to do
[2021-11-02 03:09:00] <chris2_2_2> Yep
[2021-11-02 03:09:20] <chris2_2_2> I was thinking something like helium where they need to be spread out geographically
[2021-11-02 03:09:46] <vagabond2971> we need proof of location
[2021-11-02 03:10:09] <chris2_2_2> Yep
[2021-11-02 03:10:24] <chris2_2_2> Or poc proof of consciousness. Each persons brain chip can run 1 max
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-02 02:51:50] <chris2_2_2> I’m surprised given how high gas is people aren’t screaming to increase block sizes
[2021-11-02 02:54:21] <chris2_2_2> Like if you make a second bridge when one is constantly full it’ll increase crossing volume and decrease overall traffic it won’t be a 11 increase
[2021-11-02 02:54:45] <chris2_2_2> Also blocks could probably be 10x bigger or more with current software and hardware
[2021-11-02 02:56:24] <chris2_2_2> True
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-02 03:26:33] <breeze.dev> I like this
[2021-11-02 03:26:50] <breeze.dev> no more captcha
[2021-11-02 03:27:13] <breeze.dev> though truly we need to decentralize water before any of that
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-02 03:42:16] <bitquence> is this the biggest non atomic mev gain?
[2021-11-02 03:42:38] <bitquence> someone's bot sniped a 4.44 eth cryptopunk and it already has a 180 ether bid
[2021-11-02 03:47:32] <ripostex> https://twitter.com/bertcmiller/status/1455240636676939785
[2021-11-02 03:48:54] <0x5f3759df_> damn that's sad
[2021-11-02 03:49:50] <bitquence> just seen that
[2021-11-02 03:49:51] <bitquence> crazy
[2021-11-02 03:50:01] <bitquence> praying for that guy lmao
[2021-11-02 03:53:18] <bombardier> And he paid 25 for it at the moment
[2021-11-02 05:36:20] <0xreid> that bribe is so low almost unbelievable for me
[2021-11-02 05:58:52] <_thewolf.> @HeathcliffLover Are you still working on your fantom troubles?
[2021-11-02 09:28:13] <heathclifflover> Yes definitely
[2021-11-02 09:37:16] <thogard> On ftm?
[2021-11-02 09:37:22] <thogard> How are they front running you?
[2021-11-02 09:37:38] <thogard> The whole thing is sequential per shard
[2021-11-02 09:38:08] <heathclifflover> I had to add you first just did
[2021-11-02 09:38:08] <thogard> Or do you just mean front run as in someone beats you to the arbitrage first
[2021-11-02 09:38:22] <heathclifflover> probably the latter its pretty intense there
[2021-11-02 09:38:44] <heathclifflover> basically one time i went through the top 10000 wftm holders and found theres like seven or eight bots that run the show
[2021-11-02 09:39:04] <heathclifflover> i actually have them all open in a tab right now so i can stare angrily
[2021-11-02 09:39:45] <_thewolf.> Have you been able to figure out anything on fantom? How do they get there so fast?!
[2021-11-02 09:40:05] <thogard> I imagine colocating with the protocols you’re trading on would be very important
[2021-11-02 09:40:34] <_thewolf.> I think im actually getting front run. I'm seeing transactions sized exactly the same size slightly before
[2021-11-02 09:41:00] <_thewolf.> more gas
[2021-11-02 09:41:14] <thogard> Someone is seeing your tx and trading it ahead of you to make your price worse?
[2021-11-02 09:41:29] <_thewolf.> More like someone is getting infront and executing before I can
[2021-11-02 09:41:32] <thogard> You sure they aren’t just seeing the same opportunity and beating you to it?
[2021-11-02 09:41:51] <thogard> Ah yeah that’s not frontrunning they’re just faster
[2021-11-02 09:42:22] <_thewolf.> The thing is the transactions are exactly the same they are calculating them down to the wei exactly like mine
[2021-11-02 09:42:39] <_thewolf.> And ive tested slightly different numbers
[2021-11-02 09:44:28] <thogard> Ah
[2021-11-02 09:45:10] <thogard> That’s odd that they can do that on ftm
[2021-11-02 09:45:25] <thogard> I didn’t know that ftm had gas prices though
[2021-11-02 09:45:30] <thogard> I thought it was all sequential
[2021-11-02 09:47:28] <thogard> Maybe I should go back and read the white paper again
[2021-11-02 09:52:42] <_thewolf.> yep sadly
[2021-11-02 09:53:45] <_thewolf.> Though while we're on the topic how can you make transactions go through faster? (short of running a validator node)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-02 04:19:48] <epicrubia> OOF
[2021-11-02 04:30:10] <bertcmiller> there were some token snipes in the early days that might contend with this one
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-02 05:05:20] <convexdegen> what node client do you all use ?
[2021-11-02 05:06:15] <SiegeRhino> geth
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-02 07:00:45] <breeze.dev> just came across an interesting article written by Bram Cohen (BitTorrent creator) with notable mev mentions https://www.chia.net/2021/07/13/avisionfordefiinchia.en.html
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-02 07:43:29] <vagabond2971> I don\'t doubt he\'s a smart man but I can\'t help but feel like these utxo are claiming they can do defi better while in fact they got left behind and are desperately trying to catch up in weird ways
[2021-11-02 07:43:53] <vagabond2971> also see cardano
[2021-11-02 07:53:54] <thogard> 100% agree
[2021-11-02 09:28:27] <heathclifflover> It’s a tricky little dude
[2021-11-02 09:28:37] <heathclifflover> For a poor old dude like me
[2021-11-02 09:29:59] <_thewolf.> Just sent you a dm!
[2021-11-02 09:30:18] <_thewolf.> Have you figured out anything yet?
[2021-11-02 09:31:25] <_thewolf.> I'm struggling with latency for the most part and keep getting front run!!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-02 10:25:21] <_thewolf.> I think so
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-02 10:54:37] <Deleted> so if I have lower network latency I can monitor the mempool and frontrun txs right?
[2021-11-02 10:55:53] <Deleted> I mean in fantom
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-02 11:07:36] <breeze.dev> Fair assessment
[2021-11-02 11:10:32] <breeze.dev> Depending on the profit margin it might be best to find other opportunities because eventually you will push each other to near zero profit if you are competing down to the wei already
[2021-11-02 11:11:06] <breeze.dev> This is pretty subjective but the time you spend trying to beat him might be more fruitful in another strategy
[2021-11-02 11:17:17] <thogard> With how new ftm is are there really that many strategies?
[2021-11-02 11:18:55] <breeze.dev> Haven't explored it personally may very well be the case
[2021-11-02 11:21:45] <heathclifflover> It seems like the best bots are pretty sophisticated to me
[2021-11-02 11:22:30] <heathclifflover> I can share them but if someone exploits they have to pay me a finders fee 
[2021-11-02 11:32:01] <heathclifflover> Just for fun here’s one I’ve seen a lot

[2021-11-02 11:33:12] <Deleted> two other fantom bots
[2021-11-02 11:34:05] <Deleted> finders fee x 2
[2021-11-02 11:46:14] <Psycho> I do pretty much the same thing as this bot. The only difference is that i make $0 lol
[2021-11-02 11:52:33] <breeze.dev> So y'all spam blocks and bog the network down?https://c.tenor.com/hCS1ly00EYoAAAAM/espressoclassy.gif
[2021-11-02 12:12:47] <heathclifflover> one thing ive noticed is i dont really see any exploits on ftm
[2021-11-02 12:19:01] <thogard> Are there any new protocols?
[2021-11-02 12:19:18] <thogard> Isn’t everything still a copy pasta?
[2021-11-02 12:20:05] <Deleted> Isn't YOLO token an exploit?
[2021-11-02 12:35:03] <heathclifflover> yeah but not like a protocol exploit
[2021-11-02 12:35:10] <heathclifflover> and yeah tbh everythings a fork
[2021-11-02 14:05:21] <rightarm> ahh okay
[2021-11-02 14:06:45] <Deleted> who produce the blocks? maybe they are running the bots
[2021-11-02 14:24:15] <Psycho> can confirm tried this on polygon and was 7 blocks behind the MEV bot that mined the same tx. oof
[2021-11-02 14:31:41] <sipox11> I use Remix
[2021-11-02 14:37:54] <lazyone8670> Not familiar with fantom but block rewards seem quite low so there should be a good incentive to some arb besides
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-02 11:55:50] <vagabond2971> gotta balance the amms brah
[2021-11-02 11:59:22] <thogard> The backrun stuff is interesting
[2021-11-02 11:59:32] <thogard> Timing looks different
[2021-11-02 11:59:44] <thogard> Lot of people landing in front of the tx
[2021-11-02 12:00:18] <thogard> Which is odd
[2021-11-02 12:01:49] <breeze.dev> It is odd actually getting a headache diving into figuring out the order
[2021-11-02 12:02:12] <breeze.dev> What are the powers delegated to nodes??
[2021-11-02 12:03:12] <thogard> I read the white paper thought I understood it… but clearly I don’t
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-02 14:04:34] <rightarm> What is this bot doing?
[2021-11-02 14:36:53] <lazyone8670> Hmm seems they never fail on their txs
[2021-11-02 14:46:34] <Psycho> yea they dont revert their tx they just return instead
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-02 15:35:23] <Olevinskyvs> Hi!We are make a lot of MEV transactions but some times flashbots relay don't get it. Blocks we are targeting is a Flashbots blocks and our reward is higher. Where can i get technical support about it?
[2021-11-02 15:37:47] <sipox11> You can submit it there: https://flashbots.notion.site/SearcherIssueReportingForm700a5ff3843a443c993912099b4c1b56
[2021-11-02 15:38:21] <sipox11> I think they were working on a new tool to help selfdebug because they were overloaded not sure if it's out there already
[2021-11-02 15:39:18] <thogard> There’s ways to bump up accuracy
[2021-11-02 15:39:29] <thogard> Don’t give up and don’t assume it’s a validator
[2021-11-02 15:40:48] <thogard> Just keep hunting for alpha 
[2021-11-02 15:41:15] <Psycho> hunting for alpha is all i have atm 
[2021-11-02 15:47:24] <thogard> Are fantom nodes geth forks?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-02 16:33:22] <Olevinskyvs> Thanks!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-02 16:33:25] <debugged> Yes
[2021-11-02 16:33:38] <zzz7685> can metemask use flashbot?
[2021-11-02 16:45:57] <lazyone8670> So they dont pay fees for returning or is it just another way to cancel the tx?
[2021-11-02 16:47:12] <Psycho> it is just another way to cancel. idk if it improves gas usage or not when compared to a revert tho
[2021-11-02 16:48:13] <Psycho> since they spam so much it looks like they have allot of successfull tx untill you see that most of them do nothing i.e get returned
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-02 20:32:37] <breeze.dev> hi there absolutely!
[2021-11-02 20:32:44] <breeze.dev> https://medium.com/alchemistcoin/howtoaddflashbotsprotectrpctoyourmetamask3f1412a16787
[2021-11-02 20:33:11] <breeze.dev> ETH sold separately
[2021-11-02 20:33:50] <breeze.dev> You may also consider mist if doing trading; https://app.mistx.io/#/exchange however the signing of messages can feel uneasy
[2021-11-02 20:36:12] <ozinc> Just an FYI...I'm running multiple nodes one of which is is an MEVGETH node from home... everything running nicely (although initial sync took about 10 days) but my my upload bandwidth was getting caned  just installed trickle and launching geth under trickle with a sensible upload bandwidth constraint has helped immensely... if you're hitting bw issues then defo give it a shot

[2021-11-02 20:51:29] <bombardier> will try
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-02 21:44:30] <heathclifflover> Yeah it’s kind of insane how many more arbs these people land. I’ve been updating and upgrading my bot for like a month or two and I’m still maybe making 100/day while they’re making 100k
[2021-11-02 21:44:42] <heathclifflover> Really frustrating
[2021-11-02 21:48:08] <larkus23> your DMs are closed 
[2021-11-02 21:49:12] <heathclifflover> Teach me oh wise one
[2021-11-02 22:50:12] <heathclifflover> thats what im saying im not about to run my own node through aws just to maybe break even
[2021-11-02 22:56:02] <heathclifflover> so im paying like 100/month for just a node which definitely is better than just using public rpc but still can see its not great
[2021-11-02 23:08:12] <thogard> I’m just throwing out platitudes here
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-02 21:47:22] <jorgemasvidal> hey is anyone here using web3.py flashbot addition? im having problem installing it
[2021-11-02 23:08:04] <thogard> Oh I have no idea lol
[2021-11-02 23:09:08] <bertcmiller> by the way we've updated our mega bundling algos to include more bundles at the relay
[2021-11-02 23:09:30] <bertcmiller> so your inclusion rates should go up as a result
[2021-11-02 23:09:42] <bertcmiller> bundle merging algo remains the same
[2021-11-02 23:11:55] <SiegeRhino> Hey guys should we bundle up a few searchers to make more optimal mega bundles
[2021-11-02 23:12:06] <SiegeRhino> And make an alternative mega bundle submitter
[2021-11-02 23:13:01] <thogard> Xzibit meme.jpg
[2021-11-02 23:13:28] <SiegeRhino> Having limited number of searchers should allow us to make more optimal ordering without too many scalability issues
[2021-11-02 23:17:04] <ripostex> What's the current split between mega bundles / miner constructed ones? Are most miners accepting both?
[2021-11-02 23:21:50] <bertcmiller> ~50% of hashrate accepts mega bundles roughly
[2021-11-03 01:02:30] <Deleted> this seems like such a good idea
[2021-11-03 01:02:46] <Deleted> hey guys bundles on mainnet are included randomly too
[2021-11-03 01:02:57] <Deleted> no need to optimize anything else
[2021-11-03 01:05:13] <thogard> One man’s fake alpha is another man’s real alpha lol
[2021-11-03 01:09:28] <matt_9999> off topic from searching but some fella on bsc made like 50k selling a direct swap contract which was legit just pcs swap code copied and pasted claiming that it was faster than a normal pcs swap
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-03 00:31:59] <heathclifflover> Tbh if there was a flashbots system on ftm I bet it would literally halve gas prices during peak hours
[2021-11-03 00:32:22] <heathclifflover> Like seven blocks will all be failed gas transactions upping the price for fourteen blocks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-03 00:43:57] <thogard> You should see polygon
[2021-11-03 00:44:43] <thogard> Someone spread some misinformation that backruns are ordered arbitrarily and now there are a few bots that spam hundreds of transactions hoping that one will win the lottery and get placed right behind the target
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-03 01:24:58] <lastsip> if my bundle with a private tx gets unbundled and rebundled by someone else during reorg would my previously private txs be treated as mempool txs when calculating new bundle\'s mev gas price?
[2021-11-03 01:28:05] <lastsip> because if previously private txs are not treated as mempool txs it allows to use such private txs to sponsor the new bundle. Thoughts?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-03 02:22:21] <Deleted> any updates here
[2021-11-03 02:22:31] <Deleted> need to decide whether its worth jumping in myself
[2021-11-03 04:11:18] <Deleted> ok
[2021-11-03 04:14:26] <bertcmiller> will share details when we've got the technical solution deployed
[2021-11-03 04:14:38] <Deleted> is it full blocks
[2021-11-03 04:20:20] <bertcmiller> in the long term
[2021-11-03 04:20:32] <bertcmiller> short term it's more clever than that
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-03 02:51:15] <Rezan> Why none of you degens arbed this: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x89d0ae4dc1743598a540c4e33917efdce24338723b0fabf34813b79cb0ecf4c5 ? It's sending the vusd/usdc price to infinity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-03 03:16:38] <tarik0.eth> is flashloan arbin is a thing in binance smart chain ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-03 03:57:26] <co3603> are you 100% sure about it?
[2021-11-03 03:59:28] <bertcmiller> siege will stop doing it and we have a technical solution in the works
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-03 04:49:41] <Hex> guys i'm trying to listen Swap event on UniswapRouter contract but i don't get any messages dunno what am i doing wrong is this possible?

[2021-11-03 05:05:19] <Deleted> curious to see what the short term fix is
[2021-11-03 05:05:29] <Deleted> but heh jump on the free eth train
[2021-11-03 05:06:06] <SiegeRhino> Dunno but if it's not a ban/filter on the relay side (anyway there is alternative relays) then you'd need enough miners to update
[2021-11-03 05:07:44] <SiegeRhino> Anyway i got next strat in mind so i i guess it's fine to stop if that's really a problem for flashbot team 
[2021-11-03 05:08:21] <bombardier> What you have done man
[2021-11-03 05:10:28] <Deleted> i'm enjoying these

[2021-11-03 05:11:52] <SiegeRhino> My days are numbered 
[2021-11-03 05:19:12] <Deleted> alllllllll right. I had a ticket to this one too!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-03 05:43:19] <adastreamer> A quick question guys: do I need to have mevgeth be up and running to interact directly with relay rpc or mevgeth is for miners only?
[2021-11-03 06:29:37] <lazyone8670> @Eugene Khashin Only miners as far as I know
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-03 06:59:34] <inversebrah> No
[2021-11-03 06:59:52] <inversebrah> Technically yes but they changed a lot
[2021-11-03 07:00:09] <inversebrah> Not a direct fork like bsc

[2021-11-03 07:20:55] <Hex> lol
[2021-11-03 07:22:23] <Hex> but i don't understand the transaction chain here
[2021-11-03 07:24:05] <Hex> sending 0.04 taking 0.44 wtf? am i missing something?
[2021-11-03 07:26:10] <ripostex> 0xProxy made a bad trade and Ethermine took advantage of it.
[2021-11-03 07:26:21] <ripostex> KingSwap eh ... Time to add another V2 clone!
[2021-11-03 07:28:07] <Hex> i'm trying to get arb transactions but i see many transactions like i mentioned three token transfer low sent high got are those all miner wins?
[2021-11-03 07:29:48] <ripostex> It's straightforward arbitrage involving 2 LPs
[2021-11-03 07:30:07] <ripostex> 0xa3d6322696fa2c3f9d2ad13adc539c4e8a73f847

[2021-11-03 08:27:33] <ripostex> Interesting analysis here: https://twitter.com/Mudit__Gupta/status/1455627465678749696
[2021-11-03 08:35:24] <ripostex> Really clever attack
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-03 07:13:12] <Hex> what's exactly happening in this transaction?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-03 08:13:43] <dogemus> ah ethermine is taking all obvious mev? i wondered why that bot never paid bribes...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-03 08:27:27] <ripostex> Yep
[2021-11-03 08:27:49] <ripostex> TLDR: Don't use V3 TWAP for anything
[2021-11-03 09:07:24] <bombardier> literally banteg was talking about this on a tweet i think
[2021-11-03 09:08:18] <bombardier> https://twitter.com/bantg/status/1455151835828867079
[2021-11-03 09:11:02] <thogard> Anyone else having a crazy good day
[2021-11-03 09:11:42] <thogard> Seems like volume is really high
[2021-11-03 09:26:28] <ripostex> Maybe related but this one focuses on concentrated liquidity. Can move the price of even super liquid pools with orders of magnitude less downside!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-03 10:01:14] <joaorcsilva> yeah 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-03 10:09:48] <civ> hi guys how much deep knowledge do I need in order to be a profitable searcher? what's a good daily return that one can reasonably expect? I've been working with software for several years now but whenever I look at txs in #bundlealerts it looks to me that people are just bleeding ETH so I'm assuming I'm probably missing something perhaps profits being stored as something other than ETH? I see txs interacting with contracts is that necessary? can't I just run a sciprt without deploying a contract? what advantage does that interacting with a contract provide? does that optimize gas usage somehow? is it just to have an identity that can build a reputation withe flashbot tx inclusion?apologies for the many questions 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-03 12:18:51] <marjon2358> Hello I am new to searching and wondering if flashbots is supported on arbitrum and optimism?
[2021-11-03 12:31:40] <Deleted> nop
[2021-11-03 12:31:56] <Deleted> look @ the networks tab
[2021-11-03 12:32:02] <Deleted> just ETH XDAI and Polygon
[2021-11-03 12:41:20] <thogard> Polygon only on testnet so far
[2021-11-03 12:43:10] <Deleted> whats the eta on nottestnet?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-03 13:19:46] <thogard> About the same as eth 2.0
[2021-11-03 15:10:03] <Deleted> Hi
[2021-11-03 15:22:04] <debugged> So it still is 
[2021-11-03 21:09:18] <brucecarl> what behaviour will cause to low bundle score?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-03 15:10:54] <Deleted> I sent bundle to relay and there is not error in simulate. but always miner did not approve it. tip is enough much. why I can not success?
[2021-11-03 20:32:47] <Deleted> Just happened to find out what you guys did to spam flashbots
[2021-11-03 20:33:40] <Deleted> but I don't understand what's the point. The bundle score will be very low
[2021-11-04 00:06:12] <Deleted> my simulation shows 1.4 ETH profit is possible
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-03 21:56:45] <ripostex> Went back and replayed. Dunno why but for some reason I only see .03 Eth of profit and that's not even including gas costs! Does seem like there should be a larger profit there ...
[2021-11-03 22:47:16] <ripostex> Ah OK looks like there wasn't enough liquidity at WETHVUSD pool to support the arbitrage. You could trade 100K VUSD for 107K USDC but 10 WETH only gave 29K VUSD
[2021-11-04 00:21:09] <ripostex> What pools are you using? I only see a uniswap V3 and a sushiswap pool.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-04 00:20:19] <cp3co> Hi interesting thing i don't quite understand how a private TX (flashbot hidden by Metamask ?) could be sandwiched by another MEV bot ?? See this tx : https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc0eef23cb4ea8cde6768988c7b04751b949bc4912b64375edc945ea47da8823aThanks for helping me understand all this 
[2021-11-04 00:28:02] <cp3co> Ok think i got it it's directly from the pool isn't it ? Is it allowed ? 
[2021-11-04 00:36:14] <Karvdun> It can happen that you TX gets included in a block which is then uncled. When this happens your tx lands in the public mempool
[2021-11-04 00:43:31] <cp3co> Thanks for the answer how can i check if that was the case ?
[2021-11-04 00:44:52] <bertcmiller> is this your transaction?
[2021-11-04 00:46:59] <cp3co> No it's not actually so i don't have much info...
[2021-11-04 00:49:16] <ripostex> mempool txs get marked as private when they're included in bundles
[2021-11-04 00:51:29] <bertcmiller> that one was not sent via the RPC
[2021-11-04 00:51:32] <bertcmiller> as far as I can tell
[2021-11-04 00:51:42] <bertcmiller> riposte is right
[2021-11-04 00:52:32] <cp3co> Ok thanks should i understand that tx can be bundled but not sent via flashbot relay ? How to ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-04 01:24:33] <SiegeRhino> Actually any tx that is in a bundle even if that bundle doesn\'t land will get flagged as private/flashbot
[2021-11-04 01:24:51] <SiegeRhino> so if you send in a bundle all the tx in the mempool everything will be flagged private by etherscan 
[2021-11-04 01:35:54] <vblackwhale> @SiegeRhino | Flat is justice I didn't get that so etherscan flags them even if there are not mined ?
[2021-11-04 01:36:35] <vblackwhale> Do you mean you can make a bundle of tx that are not yours ?
[2021-11-04 01:41:45] <vblackwhale> I'm surprised to see this does that mean the sandwich attacker is working directly with F2Pool ?
[2021-11-04 01:44:07] <vblackwhale> I don't understand who this bundle was submitted to this is quite scary
[2021-11-04 01:44:46] <vblackwhale> The guy got served a dirty sandwich and I don't get how to prevent this from happening
[2021-11-04 01:45:27] <vblackwhale> I'll dig deeper then thanks !
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-04 02:42:28] <code0x2> either thats a mev rpc service or etherscan didnt pick it up
[2021-11-04 02:42:42] <code0x2> they dont pick up every transaction and index it even if it is public
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-04 03:29:24] <joaorcsilva> I see many bots backrunning price oracles mainly on liquidations. but fact is that who are liquidating are those accounts and not sending 1 or 2 txs but rather 50~100 per liquidation attempt. It do seems that there is a random factor especcially because some attempts are placed even in front or the price oracle itself..
[2021-11-04 03:31:55] <joaorcsilva> and its obvious that the oracle update tx was sent beforehand.. however in a quick and messy network like matic you (and nodes) don't know what tx was broadcasted first and inclusion ordem seems in fact random
[2021-11-04 03:39:44] <thogard> yeah i think it's different for the oracle stuff

[2021-11-04 03:31:09] <estrach> Hello! Good afternoon. I extend to the group a problem that I am having with Metamask. It´s here the place to ask this things?I have a wallet that was hacked somehow there is a Bot that sends my Eth directly to another Wallet. I want to recover Tokens that I have but I cannot make the transaction precisely due to lack of ETH. Finally from doing a lot of research I came up with the idea of \u200b\u200bdoing a Gasless transaction through a Flashbot and a colleague passed me this Discord link.Someone could help me?Thank you!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-04 04:52:09] <convexdegen> does someone knows what does this bot do? https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000003b3cc22af3ae1eac0440bcee416b40
[2021-11-04 04:52:58] <ripostex> Pays out bounties to bot hackers
[2021-11-04 04:53:11] <ripostex> And also makes a fine BLT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-04 05:23:11] <convexdegen> how would you go about reverse engineering a contract like this?
[2021-11-04 05:29:18] <ether_trader> The contract's not that hard to replicate it's the fact that it's constantly getting included. Probably an EDEN slot holder
[2021-11-04 05:29:59] <ether_trader> Btw did you guys resolve that whole Anubis thing?
[2021-11-04 05:33:01] <convexdegen> le is on it
[2021-11-04 05:33:16] <convexdegen> how would you replicate it?
[2021-11-04 05:37:06] <ether_trader> Seems to be written in yul. I (and lots of people here) have the same or similar contracts
[2021-11-04 05:37:54] <ether_trader> I guess you would decompile it if you really wanted to know the exact logic
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-04 06:28:33] <Arlo> I think you might be right. I believe this has happened to me before. Maybe @bertcmiller knows more.
[2021-11-04 06:29:38] <bertcmiller> Yes they are treated as mempool txs because they actually are mempool txs
[2021-11-04 06:36:51] <Arlo> What I do find odd though: I've seen very large bundles that get in after a reorg (e.g. #5 in https://flashbotsexplorer.marto.lol/?block=13546513) without paying the money much. MEV gas price doesn't include mempool tx tips (just the coinbase transfer) so the bundler would have to have paid _a lot_ to get their bundle in but they didn't. Am I missing something?
[2021-11-04 06:38:05] <Arlo> One time the bundle had over 100 transactions in it including my bundle which got unbundled in a reorg.
[2021-11-04 06:39:45] <Deleted> Sorry I am wrong 1.4ETH profit is a sandwich. But in this case only backrun is possible
[2021-11-04 06:46:39] <bertcmiller> So we look for bundles by checking to see if any transactions included in blocks were sent to the relay
[2021-11-04 06:46:45] <bertcmiller> If so we label them as bundles
[2021-11-04 06:48:34] <Arlo> oh so then these unbundled bundles are actually paying for this large bundle (through their _very_ high gas fees).
[2021-11-04 06:48:40] <bertcmiller> We can mislabel things
[2021-11-04 06:49:00] <bertcmiller> It’s very heuristics based
[2021-11-04 06:49:29] <bertcmiller> Here we saw something which was previously in the relay but landed after being uncled and thought “oh everything between that and another bundle was a giant bundle”
[2021-11-04 06:53:15] <Arlo> By labelling them as bundles is the intent to try to recreate the original bundle after a reorg? What\'s still unclear to me: are all those tx tips in this large bundle increasing the mev gas price ("score") or not.
[2021-11-04 06:53:35] <Deleted> that explains those giant rogue bundles thanks
[2021-11-04 06:53:42] <ripostex> It's just a labelling problem it's not really a bundle
[2021-11-04 06:54:08] <Arlo> ahh I see
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-04 13:19:03] <psyclonic> What's the difference between `flashbots auction  searcher` and `flashbots protect`?
[2021-11-04 15:26:45] <Deleted> encountering numerous instances of my bundle getting sent to miners with plenty of time to spare and getting beat by another with significantly lower gas
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-04 15:27:16] <Deleted> is there any information on why this happens
[2021-11-04 16:59:09] <Deleted> the miner was 2miners: PPLNS and the guy doesn't seem to have ever owned the eden token so . also the value of the trade was tiny.
[2021-11-04 17:03:46] <Deleted> it would be interesting if flashbots could make failed bundles public to some degree perhaps just listing the bundle id (or an alias) miner reward and which bundles each bundle conflicts with and not disclosing anything else. would provide some insight
[2021-11-04 17:08:10] <SiegeRhino> Well i'm a partisan of public bundle mempool so ... Would eradicate sandwiches almost completly 
[2021-11-04 18:17:44] <SiegeRhino> trusted 3rd party
[2021-11-04 18:17:57] <SiegeRhino> woah the tradfi guys had it right since the beginning
[2021-11-04 18:17:59] <SiegeRhino> who would have thought
[2021-11-04 18:20:31] <SiegeRhino> u can batch trades offchain and then execute them all in one go through uniswap by gathring all trades to one trusted 3rd party (cowswap)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-04 16:32:24] <sipox11> Most likely it’s ethermine’s bot or an eden tenant
[2021-11-04 16:32:33] <sipox11> It’s very annoying
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-04 16:51:57] <_grimac> Most mining pools have now at least one bot
[2021-11-04 17:17:55] <bombardier> Well welcome to the PPLNS and F2Pool Old club my man
[2021-11-04 17:19:27] <vblackwhale> I've read somewhere that Flashbots condemns using it's tech for sandwich attacks but do they do something about the offenders ?
[2021-11-04 18:35:43] <vblackwhale> Could they not ban frontrunners and sandwichers from using the service ? They would probably find an alternative but at least they would not support those type of traders
[2021-11-04 18:47:49] <Karvdun> Ethermine is already blocking frontrunners / sandwitchers from their flashbotsrelay
[2021-11-04 18:50:37] <vblackwhale> I think there are some cases where extremism in the favor of supposed defi principles shows flaws
[2021-11-04 18:52:29] <vblackwhale> Somewhere there was some code of conduct for flashbots even if I can\'t find the page anymore
[2021-11-04 18:52:46] <vblackwhale> If rules are not enforced what are they for ?
[2021-11-04 20:25:22] <anarz> You still have to trust someone even with such system you'll ever need to trust someone anyway maybe 0x orders are the nearest thing to a solution
[2021-11-04 21:50:25] <breeze.dev> whoa
[2021-11-04 21:50:47] <breeze.dev> I get what you are saying but putting it on the user is not dai wei there is no flaw these are features of the system
[2021-11-04 21:55:00] <vagabond2971> I can't wait for decentralized staking pools
[2021-11-04 21:56:07] <thal0x> The UX of everything is pretty terrible for the average user. You have to really dedicate some time in order to understand everything and right now I feel like there's a pretty big influx of people who are just trying to use some apps without having to study blockchains lol
[2021-11-04 21:56:24] <thal0x> I even remember when I first set up metamask I was beyond confused
[2021-11-04 22:12:52] <breeze.dev> I agree especially for people who came in after eip 1559 to be presented with all those fields (if manually editing)
[2021-11-04 22:13:56] <breeze.dev> one day I was using metamask and the price of ethereum was marked as 44 cents or something crazy like that consequently the gas prices were off by large margin
[2021-11-04 22:14:31] <breeze.dev> though on the other hand some of crypto intended to decentralize and make available to average joe it's certainly done that
[2021-11-04 22:14:47] <breeze.dev> still up to the end user to learn the system and use it but atleast they have access to it if nothing else
[2021-11-04 22:16:10] <breeze.dev> I suspect in the next 58 years bitcoin and ethereum if not crypto in general will be taught at many schools as part of the curriculum and common knowledge on the systems will accelerate in spread but who knows
[2021-11-04 23:47:48] <breeze.dev> flashbots protect is more or less for the average everyday user
[2021-11-04 23:48:53] <breeze.dev> the difference is that in flashbots protect your transaction will get placed in a single tx bundle for you and will get held in a queue of sorts till it gets put into a block with flash bots auction  searcher there no real queue in this fashion instead your transaction/bundle gets placed in your target block or not at all
[2021-11-04 23:49:19] <breeze.dev> flashbots protect uses flashbots auction  searcher itself
[2021-11-05 03:04:25] <thogard> Let’s not act like it has to be a uni v2 pool for a sandwich trade to work
[2021-11-05 03:05:26] <thogard> I think the biggest culprit is the UI for these dexes and the slow block time of eth
[2021-11-05 03:05:49] <thogard> Faster blocktime = faster UI price updates = users can safely set lower slippage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-04 17:19:17] <brucecarl> many bots have violate the flashbots rules,especially the miner's bots
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-04 19:45:40] <anarz> Users are the flaw. Miners are already supporting antifrontrun measures with private RPCs and DEXes allows to set a slippage tolerance isnt enough ?
[2021-11-04 20:17:05] <SiegeRhino> Most users don't actually care about frontrunning. They buying SHIB to turn 1k into 1 million if they lose 0.5% to a sandwich attack it's whatever.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-04 22:26:18] <psyclonic> Can anyone help me understand the difference between `flashbots auction  searcher` and `flashbots protect`? They seem to be playing in the same space. As far as I can see the docs for each doesn’t mention the other though.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-05 03:35:33] <ether_trader> Do you guys use hetzner? How do I keep the geth node running after I've closed the ssh session.
[2021-11-05 03:38:51] <vagabond2971> best way is to have a background service like systemd. but tmux also works
[2021-11-05 03:39:27] <vagabond2971> not sure what's special about hetzner tho
[2021-11-05 03:42:41] <ether_trader> Do you maybe have a script for it? Only mentioned hetzner if by chance they block stuff like systemd or setting cronjobs
[2021-11-05 03:44:24] <vagabond2971> if they block background services then I would just launch geth in a tmux session
[2021-11-05 03:44:47] <vagabond2971> if you lose ssh just relogin and attach
[2021-11-05 03:45:28] <vagabond2971> but I don't see why they would do that
[2021-11-05 03:46:09] <vagabond2971> for systemd something like this: https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/366/howcanirungoethereumasdaemonprocessonubuntu
[2021-11-05 03:55:10] <ether_trader> Thanks @vagabond I'll try that
[2021-11-05 05:21:10] <raquo.> honestly I use screen for early projects all the time way easier than remembering the voodoo for setting up a new systemd service
[2021-11-05 05:21:21] <raquo.> just don't crash 
[2021-11-05 05:27:00] <prceasar> Yeah screen is simple and it works.
[2021-11-05 05:28:05] <vagabond2971> if it crashes you are fucked anyway
[2021-11-05 05:28:45] <vagabond2971> every time geth crashes I wipe the disk and resync from genesis 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-05 04:49:57] <standrd> Other option less pretty would be to run it in a screen @ether_trader
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-05 06:51:09] <ether_trader> So I tried the commandgeth rpc &amp;
[2021-11-05 06:52:25] <ether_trader> But it doesn\'t seem to work. And after I input disown and pkill geth it still seems to be running when I try ps ax | grep geth
[2021-11-05 06:54:19] <breeze.dev> can you get to the console
[2021-11-05 06:55:35] <nathanworsley> Does anyone know how sockets are permissioned by the OS to individual applications?
[2021-11-05 06:58:01] <nathanworsley> How do programs like wireshark get around these permissions?
[2021-11-05 06:58:08] <breeze.dev> it depends on the OS and version
[2021-11-05 06:58:21] <ether_trader> Ok I got it working with nohup nohup geth rpc &amp;
[2021-11-05 06:58:49] <breeze.dev> if you are running wireshark as administrator it can use winsock kernel (right click &gt; run as administrator or under properties tick the box under sec. tab)
[2021-11-05 06:58:58] <ether_trader> Seems to be running fine when I close the session thanks everyone
[2021-11-05 06:59:46] <breeze.dev> have to allow windows firewall aswell
[2021-11-05 06:59:55] <breeze.dev> cheers
[2021-11-05 06:59:56] <nathanworsley> So Linux systems will have an equivalent kernel process that can interfere with sockets that are owned by other applications?
[2021-11-05 07:01:29] <breeze.dev> yea making up the tcp/ip stack
[2021-11-05 07:02:03] <breeze.dev> a socket buffer is created which is basically the shared mem between your app and kernel
[2021-11-05 07:05:29] <nathanworsley> Thanks that's really helpful. I'm sick of my computer telling me what I'm allowed to touch
[2021-11-05 07:08:50] <breeze.dev> between that and the bank telling us how much we can spend it is quite stressful
[2021-11-05 07:09:03] <breeze.dev> https://tenor.com/view/cheersnarcospabloescobargif13646037
[2021-11-05 07:11:19] <nathanworsley> Yeah F banks one day we'll just replace them with some kind of ERC20
[2021-11-05 07:12:25] <nathanworsley> What's the point of asking me for information on my source of funds if I'm the only one qualified to explain it to you
[2021-11-05 07:13:25] <nathanworsley> Sick of being treated like I'm sketchy just because I have no product services customers or website

[2021-11-05 07:15:46] <breeze.dev> and even fractions of them guarantors and what not

[2021-11-05 08:19:02] <ether_trader> Ah it's because of how mappings are stored
[2021-11-05 09:38:07] <kendrick> Something to note is that solidity uses keccak256(key slot) and vyper uses keccask256(slot key)
[2021-11-05 10:19:24] <kendrick> Nah its been around for a while. I was trying to manipulate the bal of curve's LP token balance but couldn't so I wrote a tool to brute force it with no luck. When I swapped slot key around it just worked

[2021-11-05 09:50:30] <ripostex> Stupid proxy contracts. Update removed my (small) alpha

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-05 10:01:21] <Deleted> oh shit is the vyper update new?
[2021-11-05 10:01:26] <Deleted> i think what they used was all over the place
[2021-11-05 11:28:59] <Deleted> since the alpha is gone can you share it now?
[2021-11-05 11:37:17] <ripostex> Sadly the new upgrade now explicitly calculates before and after weth balances so you can't sweep the excess any more
[2021-11-05 11:40:43] <Deleted> It's impressive you can find this kind of alpha
[2021-11-05 11:41:20] <ripostex> Saw someone doing this manually a couple times for ~ 10 Eth or so
[2021-11-05 11:41:50] <ripostex> So of course once I implemented didn't really happen much afterwards only made .3 eth or so
[2021-11-05 11:42:01] <ripostex> Ah well
[2021-11-05 11:42:44] <Deleted> So it must be a big bot contract
[2021-11-05 11:42:55] <ripostex> Pretty much all my alpha comes from looking at what other ppl are doing

[2021-11-05 11:36:29] <ripostex> Contract allowed you to do swaps etc on multiple DEXes. Very occasionally some weth would be left on the contract which you could claim by submitting a noop trade. I'm guessing this occurs when a V3 trade doesn't end up taking the whole input because it's eaten through all the liquidity.

[2021-11-05 17:49:02] <f_sheep> Hey guys looks like this channel is a bit more active. Have an issue I posted about in #general and would really appreciate any guidance 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-05 19:17:45] <Strategst!> I just ping a presale guy on hetzner and got a legal like any crypto related stuff is forbidden there? Anyone has problems when running nodes?
[2021-11-05 19:48:36] <thal0x> I currently have 2 nodes on hetzner no problem
[2021-11-05 19:48:56] <breeze.dev> not sure if there is a word for this kind of annoyance same is true when doing token0 token1 in uniswap pairs (where sometimes token0 is on token1 side and vice versa)
[2021-11-05 19:49:42] <breeze.dev> this is usually only said to be directed at crypto mining
[2021-11-05 19:49:54] <breeze.dev> now they said nodes specifically in your case
[2021-11-05 19:49:59] <ether_trader> Well at least we know now they arent looking at out code 
[2021-11-05 19:50:17] <bombardier> that you know
[2021-11-05 19:50:17] <breeze.dev> not sure if they would enforce that right away more likely if you are running the resources into the ground (100% days on end maybe){
[2021-11-05 19:50:33] <breeze.dev> 100% they are 
[2021-11-05 19:50:37] <breeze.dev> ah the kvm is on
[2021-11-05 19:51:23] <breeze.dev> i work with all of the larger hosting providers only had problems with mining in most cases never had any problems running nodes or validators
[2021-11-05 19:52:03] <thal0x> I did run a trading bot on render.com and they flagged me for mining but it was just a error in their detection system and they reverted it
[2021-11-05 19:52:11] <ether_trader> So how would you obfuscate running searchers code then?
[2021-11-05 19:52:41] <ether_trader> Just compile locally?
[2021-11-05 19:52:55] <thal0x> I think if anything they'd be monitoring your network requests
[2021-11-05 19:53:01] <thal0x> Could be wrong though
[2021-11-05 19:54:53] <bombardier> well at the end the can see the jsonrpc calls in the network
[2021-11-05 19:55:03] <bombardier> I dont think you can ofuscate that
[2021-11-05 19:56:52] <ether_trader> No I mean if you want to hide your alpha
[2021-11-05 19:57:15] <ether_trader> Yhey cant see the strategy from rpc calls
[2021-11-05 19:59:32] <thal0x> I really doubt the IT people at hetzner are scouring their servers searching for MEV strategies
[2021-11-05 20:08:44] <ether_trader> Ok not strategies but private keys maybe
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-05 20:13:11] <kendrick> Haha I know exactly what u mean my fellow storage reader hehe
[2021-11-06 00:03:48] <0xreid> well u know who it was if ur wallet gets drained at least
[2021-11-06 02:23:46] <edgararout> make a simple contract decompile it connect the dots rinse repeat with more complicated contracts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-05 20:39:29] <lazyone8670> Also have nodes on Hetzner and never got complaints by now also guess its bec they are afraid of mining
[2021-11-05 20:40:19] <lazyone8670> They have btw opened a US location in the last days
[2021-11-05 20:56:44] <0xalcibiades> Sounds like it's time to get into the mev infra business.
[2021-11-06 01:42:02] <lazyone8670> Can you guys recommend resources on how to read/understand decompiled solidity contracts?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-06 02:40:58] <Deleted> or just spend a lot of time just walking thru the logic
[2021-11-06 02:41:22] <ivacherednichenko> https://poap.gallery/event/10162
[2021-11-06 02:41:29] <Deleted> you get faster at it after a while. it's not any harder than nondecompiled code just significantly more tedious
[2021-11-06 02:41:30] <ivacherednichenko> can you give me one thank you
[2021-11-06 02:42:52] <lazyone8670> Thanks for your replies.. guess I have quite some work to do
[2021-11-06 02:42:59] <cgst> I have a silly question and I\'d appreciate your thoughts:What\'s the typical endtoend MEV latency and what % of that is consumed by the searcher? By endtoend I mean emitter → p2p gossip → searcher → relay → miner.
[2021-11-06 02:44:01] <alexo314> Hi @edgararout 
[2021-11-06 02:46:03] <edgararout> Howdy  good to be back in this discord
[2021-11-06 02:51:43] <alexo314> good to see you here 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-06 03:08:14] <ripostex> So satisfying when your arb makes it to the top of an Ethermine block. Suck it Ethermine bot!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-06 04:31:47] <Deleted> Anyone else have occasional problems simulating other user's swaps on uv3? I think it is a gas limit thing but also I only seem to have the problem on goerli.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-06 05:15:39] <breeze.dev> I haven't hit an arb in over 24 hours ask me a question
[2021-11-06 05:16:04] <thogard> Is your computer plugged in?

[2021-11-06 05:22:02] <thal0x> And I thought I was having a bad day 
[2021-11-06 05:28:49] <Deleted> Guys does anyone here use golang cryptoriums flashbot library
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-06 07:17:17] <TP199> what is this some kind of fanboy channel?!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-06 07:48:11] <breeze.dev> how'd I overlook this
[2021-11-06 08:30:35] <breeze.dev> welcome back edgar 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-06 08:24:20] <hasssy> does anyone prefer erigon over geth for MEV?
[2021-11-06 08:30:58] <breeze.dev> never used it personally I'm interested to hear others on this as well
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-06 08:47:57] <neslinesli93> it's not all hate and dramahttps://interprether.tommasopifferi.com/?text_filter=Lov
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-06 12:40:34] <thal0x> @edgararout if i remember correctly i remember seeing a tweet about getting a group together to share geth modifications. is that still a thing?
[2021-11-06 14:29:33] <cgst> We use Erigon extensively but not for MEV. I like it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-06 14:46:14] <wowlad> Does/will runloop do MEV?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-06 16:08:58] <___conqueror___> do you guys hedge against eth at all? e.g. if you run a bot and it makes some ETH the amount of money you make is still sensitive to the price of eth
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-06 17:50:52] <thotiana> this is same edgararout from twitter?
[2021-11-06 17:51:01] <thotiana> i thought your account was @edgar
[2021-11-06 17:51:43] <thal0x> i typically do my arbs in USDC for this reason. and then invest my profits as i see fit
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-06 18:21:47] <Strategst!> Random q for bsc sandwich guys. How complicated is your scam prevention schemes?
[2021-11-06 20:28:11] <bertcmiller> @SiegeRhino | Flat is justice does
[2021-11-06 20:34:56] <SiegeRhino> Welp not right now but it's something i think about yeh

[2021-11-06 21:19:43] <nathanworsley> Lend your ETH profit as collateral to borrow more ETH repeat in a circular fashion
[2021-11-06 21:19:59] <ripostex> Now we're talking!
[2021-11-06 21:20:10] <Deleted> suddenly these 95% miner %s seem much lower if you're on 20x leverage!
[2021-11-06 21:20:29] <nathanworsley> Don't be one of those guys who chickens out of a little downside price exposure
[2021-11-06 21:21:19] <ripostex> Only hedging I do is selling Eth for taxes. Kinda regret that now 
[2021-11-06 21:21:37] <ripostex> Sold most around $1500
[2021-11-06 21:24:08] <breeze.dev> was just thinking we'd get to enjoy low gas prices today refreshed and 280 gwei
[2021-11-06 21:31:24] <vagabond2971> I hedge by panic selling a little eth every time it goes down 5%
[2021-11-06 21:31:31] <vagabond2971> works out pretty well actually
[2021-11-06 21:31:42] <vagabond2971> just panic sold some lmao
[2021-11-06 21:32:14] <Deleted> we sell as it goes up :)))
[2021-11-06 21:32:24] <vagabond2971> oh I just learned it's called stop loss 
[2021-11-06 21:33:01] <vagabond2971> I can never do that..
[2021-11-06 21:33:42] <breeze.dev> damnit made a bad trade 2 minutes later transaction notification for mev arrives erasing loss
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2021-11-06 22:07:03] <bombardier> You cant lose if you never sell

[2021-11-06 22:40:30] <thal0x> how are you this deep down the ETH rabbit hole and still panic selling
[2021-11-06 22:45:38] <vagabond2971> lol can't control my monkey brain. it's a problem
[2021-11-06 23:32:13] <edgararout> I migrated to a new iPhone and stupidly lost my 2fas hence new account
[2021-11-06 23:34:50] <thal0x> I have some that I could share however I'm sure the hacks I've implemented aren't super unique. It's something I'd really love to collaborate and learn more about with others though
[2021-11-06 23:36:57] <edgararout> It’s not my mev fund thing  just coders talking about geth hacking  sharing a commonish base layer  I’m trying to keep some oss culture alive in mev
[2021-11-06 23:37:20] <edgararout> Probably we are all doing similar ish things  dm me
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2023-10-10 22:36:00] <cyberspace3241> This is the share ranking of the builders I found. Do I want to send my bundler request at the same time as the top builder?
[2023-10-10 22:37:54] <ripostex> Fake (old) news
[2023-10-10 22:39:02] <cyberspace3241> I found eden builder inside. How should I send requests to all builders at the same time? Is there any documentation or github that I can refer to?
[2023-10-10 22:40:13] <Ezekiel> Banana ties bribes together
[2023-10-10 22:40:31] <Ezekiel> Since they're all from the same router
[2023-10-10 22:40:44] <Ezekiel> That's how they get more bundle than others
[2023-10-10 22:41:57] <cyberspace3241> If so why does Bananagun only package 4 users instead of all users who need to purchase this token such as 10 or more?
[2023-10-10 22:43:03] <cyberspace3241> Do you mean that we can only send bundler requests to one of the builders but cannot send requests to multiple builders at the same time? In this case we can only send it to the builder with the highest share
[2023-10-10 22:47:03] <mool_man> no idea  it will be fun to try it
[2023-10-10 22:48:31] <Ezekiel> Because they have 4 pending users who wanted to snipe
[2023-10-10 22:48:54] <Ezekiel> This depends on volume This can vary like 4 different wallets make up 1 bundle from a single user
[2023-10-10 22:48:57] <Ezekiel> many such cases
[2023-10-10 22:49:03] <cyberspace3241> May I ask if we can send bundler requests to multiple builders at the same time? Is there any documentation or github that I can refer to? Thank you.
[2023-10-10 22:49:15] <Ezekiel> yes u can
[2023-10-10 22:53:12] <cyberspace3241> Great I searched online and couldn't find any articles about sending requests to multiple builders at the same time. Can you provide some guidance?
[2023-10-10 22:58:35] <mool_man> can we use @flashbots/ethersproviderbundle to send bundle to an others builders except rpc.flashbots !?
[2023-10-10 23:36:50] <cyberspace3241> All I can think of is to build a builder list then build flashbotprovider for each builder in the list and then send bundle requests to each flashbotprovider.
[2023-10-11 00:11:17] <breeze.dev> consider the potential consequences
[2023-10-11 00:11:47] <breeze.dev> and do some research on the builder before blindly adding them to your list
[2023-10-11 00:14:59] <ripostex> @breeze show me on the doll where the builder touched you
[2023-10-11 00:25:19] <cyberspace3241> cool
[2023-10-11 00:25:28] <breeze.dev> there probably aren't even 12 trustable builders in the space 
[2023-10-11 00:26:10] <fm1367> 10 builders
[2023-10-11 00:28:58] <fm1367> check DMs 
[2023-10-11 02:53:17] <santoshinakamoto> Resending what i had asked previously with some context. I am an ex hft developer. Do you think cex dex arbitrage is profitable in this day and edge? Would love if someone can drop any advice and/or links
[2023-10-11 03:03:38] <egor22> ECDSAsecp256k1 key pair for Flashbots to identify youhow get it?plz i lost my token
[2023-10-11 03:08:02] <yannickcrypto> ex hft developer but ask in discord if a strat is still profitable?
[2023-10-11 03:19:16] <santoshinakamoto>  yes
[2023-10-11 03:19:38] <santoshinakamoto> i wish i was. i am santoshi not satoshi
[2023-10-11 03:19:54] <yannickcrypto> ???
[2023-10-11 03:20:26] <Ezekiel> HFT which is Hashflow
[2023-10-11 03:21:16] <breeze.dev> satoshi would say that 
[2023-10-11 03:21:21] <breeze.dev> welcome aboard
[2023-10-11 03:21:36] <breeze.dev> is this your my employee number is 1 woznak moment?

[2023-10-11 03:22:56] <seesoftware> chad moment
[2023-10-11 03:22:58] <santoshinakamoto> i hope satoshi is not watching this conversation. he will be very upset
[2023-10-11 03:23:22] <breeze.dev> damn you 
[2023-10-11 03:23:30] <Ezekiel> He said he's very disappointed of you
[2023-10-11 03:24:02] <breeze.dev> to answer your question San` yes arbitrage is profitable still
[2023-10-11 03:24:07] <breeze.dev> arbitrage is profitable by definition
[2023-10-11 03:24:10] <breeze.dev> buy low sell high innit
[2023-10-11 03:24:24] <breeze.dev> but i get the feeling you just wanted to say something without being recognized as the creator
[2023-10-11 03:24:36] <breeze.dev> https://tenor.com/view/smokingmikemcluskyjeremyrennermayorofkingstownlightingupgif24043063
[2023-10-11 03:25:13] <santoshinakamoto> From the data i pulled from blockchain and coinbase  it looked like it was for some of the tokens (given you are exposed to the volatility).But i also saw some threads which said that its not anymore .
[2023-10-11 03:25:21] <santoshinakamoto> haha
[2023-10-11 03:25:23] <santoshinakamoto> lol
[2023-10-11 03:25:46] <breeze.dev> its not profitable in the sense that it's extremely competitive and defi volume is at all time lows
[2023-10-11 03:25:56] <breeze.dev> but it's profitable in the sense that it can still occur in the wild on chain
[2023-10-11 03:26:21] <seesoftware> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DCAC1j2HTY this guy will be upset
[2023-10-11 03:26:35] <breeze.dev> damn i forgot to finish my bsv liquidation bot
[2023-10-11 03:26:54] <breeze.dev> the only person he had backing him just stated he doubts craig's credibility a while ago

[2023-10-11 03:28:39] <breeze.dev> ```I can confirm I have departed from @nChainGlobal as its Group CEO with immediate effect after reporting several serious issues to the board of nChain Group including what I believe is a conspiracy to defraud nChain shareholders orchestrated by a significant shareholder. I also had concerns about the ultimate beneficiary shareholder and the real people behind DW Discovery fund registered in Cayman. The chairman also took instructions from shadow directors which I didn’t accept I have also reported that I have found compelling evidence that Dr Craig Wright has manipulated documents with the aim to deceive the court he is Satoshi. I’m today myself convinced that Dr Craig Wright is NOT Satoshi and I’m persuaded he will lose all his legal battles. The board didn’t take action and my job becomes clearly untenable. One of the things I recommended the Chairman of the board was to sack Dr Craig Wright. I feel sorry for all the great people that work in the company but I don’t want to be part of something I clearly don’t believe in. #faketoshi```
[2023-10-11 03:31:01] <seesoftware> i dont feel like the real satoshi coming back would be bullish
[2023-10-11 03:31:10] <seesoftware> seems like he could dump a shit ton

[2023-10-11 00:24:19] <fm1367> Hey @cyberspace you should try Echo its a unified endpoint to submit to top 12 builders here docs: https://echo.chainbound.io/. It also has great analytics to understand builders response and inclusion delays

[2023-10-11 16:32:11] <yannickcrypto> i heard storys where they made it in 7 minutes but idk if it was larp
[2023-10-11 16:33:32] <yannickcrypto> for a full swap you need to transfer the tokens to the pair and then call swap() to get the other tokens out with a smart contract you can do this easy in one tx without contract you need two transactions what will add a extra 21000 gas to your bundle (every initial tx cost 21k gas)
[2023-10-11 16:34:01] <yannickcrypto> stuff like univ3 you cant even swap without contract because of the callback that need some logic behind it
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2023-10-11 09:05:45] <the0x> we only run reth
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2023-10-11 09:55:01] <araka8765> How faster reth is than geth ?
[2023-10-11 10:08:40] <araka8765> I would shift from geth to reth in next year.
[2023-10-11 10:29:39] <araka8765> I am wondering how long does it take to convert go lang code to rust.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2023-10-11 10:57:37] <joaorcsilva> 10 minutes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2023-10-11 12:35:15] <calvinguy> beginner here if flashbot already provides atomicity from bundling transactions what is the purpose of using smart contracts instead of just swapping directly ? Doesn't smart contract use more gas?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2023-10-11 13:20:32] <seraph444> hey guys when I use the official flashbot relay does it automatically forward my bundles to many builders or only specifically to flashbots (builder) itself? If you want to get your transaction included in the next block ideally you'd want every builder to have your bundle as to increase chances to get into the block right?So a couple questions: Does the flashbot relay transmit my bundles to many builders?if no: Does a unified solution exist that forwards my bundles to e.g. top 10 builders?if no: Would my only way be to send my bundle to each and every builder manually?

[2023-10-11 22:46:17] <breeze.dev> you would have to submit your bundle to builders of your choosing I\'ve read that there are some unified solutions that do send your bundle to multiple builders but you are better off doing it yourself

[2023-10-11 23:20:49] <mariorock.> can you help like to create contract with multiple funcs where can i go to put my complex contract variables into a search bar to create a contract sol
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2023-10-11 23:39:54] <alfalafels> no
[2023-10-11 23:41:20] <seesoftware> keep in mind some rpc calls are not implemented yet
[2023-10-11 23:41:43] <seesoftware> i think like trace_filter or something like that is not impl yet

[2023-10-12 01:42:16] <wjmelements> If the US is paying $6 billion for 5 hostages I am in the wrong industry. I should be running a paramilitary operation focused on countertourism.

[2023-10-12 02:22:15] <yannickcrypto> good profit
[2023-10-12 02:23:50] <seesoftware> mf has like 99% reverts
[2023-10-12 02:24:48] <yannickcrypto> and then lands this one tx with 130k profit
[2023-10-12 02:27:01] <seesoftware> tbh i wish flashbots was more like this i would rather have 1 tx with 100% of profit than 100 tx with 1% profit
[2023-10-12 02:27:24] <seesoftware> kinda would be like funny lottery
[2023-10-12 02:28:04] <bengra> trial and error
[2023-10-12 02:28:34] <.sheero> how much losses is that contract taking?
[2023-10-12 02:28:47] <yannickcrypto> you can do it?
[2023-10-12 02:30:02] <seesoftware> no because every opp is just going to get 100% prefered by 99% briber instead of it being by chance
[2023-10-12 02:30:17] <yannickcrypto> just 80% of all blocks is mevboost
[2023-10-12 02:30:41] <yannickcrypto> read into beaconchain easy to filter all this validators that participate in mevboost then try to compete in the mempool
[2023-10-12 02:30:56] <bengra> wallet has 5k tx's and cost per tx looks like 0.05$. 5k  0,05$ = 250$. 250$ for 130k profit sounds good. And the wallet has highly likely not for all 5k tx's reverts.
[2023-10-12 02:31:05] <yannickcrypto> skip opportunitys when the next validator is likkely mevboost go for it if not
[2023-10-12 02:37:19] <seesoftware> you missed 660k transactions
[2023-10-12 02:38:52] <bengra> no way 
[2023-10-12 02:39:14] <bengra> from all the other wallets probably right
[2023-10-12 02:39:50] <bengra> ah dang I see the contract. Geez lol
[2023-10-12 02:40:09] <seesoftware> im sure he was in the green though
[2023-10-12 02:48:23] <yannickcrypto> he have 400k in his wallet
[2023-10-12 03:25:15] <yannickcrypto> someone wrote me DM to delete this

[2023-10-12 03:25:20] <yannickcrypto> this is alpha for you? lmao

[2023-10-12 02:45:05] <bengra> with the last 130k hitter for sure 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2023-10-12 04:22:31] <the0x> or just look at available slots from relays
[2023-10-12 08:45:39] <yannickcrypto> yes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2023-10-12 07:14:31] <seraph444> are there stats around block building market shares? i.e. how much of today\'s blocks are made by builders"? and how many do the miners just build themselves via public mempool?
[2023-10-12 07:15:09] <seraph444> lmk if I got it wrong conceptually 
[2023-10-12 07:33:20] <pandakk> would a bundle be valid if every tx's txhash in it is also a member of revertingTxHashes? I know it's a weird idea and defeats the purpose of a bundle but I would rather use this over private txs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2023-10-12 10:21:30] <seraph444> whats benefit of bundles over private tx?
[2023-10-12 10:23:21] <yannickcrypto> You can send several tx in your order as you wish
[2023-10-12 10:24:12] <seraph444> but in case of a single transaction
[2023-10-12 10:27:57] <pandakk> im sending several there is no benefit for a bundle of 1 tx vs a private tx
[2023-10-12 10:28:18] <pandakk> i want a consistent ordering just dont care about the atomic execution
[2023-10-12 10:30:51] <seraph444> I saw flashbots has the feature of forwarding private txs to many other builders besides flashbots itself does bundle have the same feature or only privatetx has it?
[2023-10-12 10:31:31] <pandakk> you can do that just fine but you need to send them to the other builders yourself
[2023-10-12 10:32:01] <seraph444> so with private I can do all via 1 call to flashbot relay but for bundle I need to do it individually?
[2023-10-12 10:33:19] <seraph444> or could I do the same with bundle?
[2023-10-12 10:41:41] <joaorcsilva> fact is that every word written here plays against searchers

After missing a couple 4digit payouts (one because I wasn't setting priority fee at all the other one because there was a bug in my attempt to set the priority fee) I scored a 3digit one and at least now I'm profitable. Beware! If this exponential progression continues in a few months time I will be scoring trillions!
[2023-10-12 18:09:11] <yannickcrypto> imagine dont do mev anymore and share all this alpha and make others searchers life as hard as my pp in the morning

[2023-10-12 15:25:30] <breeze.dev> you can reduce chance of getting reorged by sending a single tx in a bundle
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2023-10-12 18:44:34] <paulscreen> Having an unexpected issue with simulations failing occasionally. I\'ve narrowed it down to when I simulate with a block state where the block fee recipient is a contract or more specifically when that contract is a Gnosis Safe proxy e.g. 0xa3A5Ef800b47D503E61EE7f0bAF7Ee80BCC5fbFb My transaction fails when doing a block.coinbase.transfer which drops into the GnosisSafeProxy fallback and gives me an out of gas error (I\'m not out of gas it\'s reverting with called function does not exist in the contract"). What am I missing?
[2023-10-12 19:03:23] <joaorcsilva> https://tenor.com/view/joaquinphoenixgladiatorthumbsdowngif13238004
[2023-10-12 19:15:06] <joeblogg801> The problem here is that when using block.coinbase.transfer there's not enough gas set aside for the fallback call. This is often because the fallback function uses a cold storage and requires a lot of gas. Since you can't predict the coinbase address beforehand you can't warmup the storage in advance using an access list. You could include this address and its slots in the access list regardless but that would be costly if the coinbase doesn't match this contract. The solution is straightforward: just use more gas when transferring funds to the coinbase address. By default when using block.coinbase.transfer the fallback will have only 2300 gas available which is not enough to access cold storage if fallback uses it. And it appears Gnosis Safe proxy uses a storage the first line in the fallback function is `let _singleton := and(sload(0) 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff)`  i.e. it reads from cold slot 0 that will fail with out of gas immediately
[2023-10-12 20:18:02] <paulscreen> I didn’t think about the gas that makes perfect sense thank you!
[2023-10-12 21:55:55] <yannickcrypto> `Since you can't predict the coinbase address beforehand you can't warmup the storage in advance using an access list. `send several bundles with accessList + matching coinbase and revert if it is different address
[2023-10-12 22:36:52] <yannickcrypto> Address?
[2023-10-12 22:37:32] <yannickcrypto> I remember one builder said what I’m doing because I had a inclusion rate of 1%
[2023-10-12 22:37:42] <yannickcrypto> Avg searcher had something like 0.01%
[2023-10-12 22:38:02] <yannickcrypto> I would like to know what they spamming
[2023-10-12 22:46:08] <breeze.dev> Are you a flashbots bundle? Because you\'re the perfect sequence I\'ve been waiting for baby

[2023-10-12 23:41:31] <shunshow> Someone traded 130k to 0.001 cent prolly thanks to a bug in the aggregator that was used
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2023-10-12 23:51:47] <joaorcsilva> majority UIs only simulate against major tokens.. if you gonna swap highvolume shitcoins you must be aware.. and especcially don't ignore the 90%+ slippage red warning that popups
[2023-10-12 23:54:33] <mteam88> best aggregator: https://swap.defillama.com/
[2023-10-13 00:00:06] <joaorcsilva> Maybe its obvious but I don't trade shitcoins often.. so I saw just yesterday when i was about to trade shitcoin A (worth $1000 to USDT). It was outputting me 0 USDT return.. after short investigation I realized that the liquidity in Uniswap V2 but on two pairs shitcoin A  shitboin B; and shitcoin B  USDT. Althought the liquidity was all concentrated in univ2 the UI was unable to get a proper route so I had to make the middle swap .. Cowswap and 1Inch were also outputting 0 but on the end i got like 950$+ out
[2023-10-13 00:08:17] <seesoftware> is it good?
[2023-10-13 00:08:32] <mteam88> yes
[2023-10-13 00:08:44] <mteam88> defillama actually has a whole suite of products
[2023-10-13 00:09:02] <mteam88> but the llamaswap gas estimation is good
[2023-10-13 00:09:13] <mteam88> and the 0x integration is really good
[2023-10-13 00:09:34] <mteam88> &gt; DefiLlama takes 0 fee on swaps.&gt; &gt; You'll get the exact same price swapping through DefiLlama as what you'd get swapping through the chosen aggregator directly.
[2023-10-13 00:09:51] <seesoftware> yea i noticed making an optimal route is not that trivial
[2023-10-13 00:10:00] <seesoftware> atleast if you want it fast

[2023-04-09 19:14:59] <duoxehyon> im now extra cautious have my wallet seed written in a paper lol not keeping main wallet in windows etc...
[2023-04-09 19:15:19] <yannickcrypto> just buy a ledger fren
[2023-04-09 19:15:43] <duoxehyon> ledger is trash
[2023-04-09 19:15:47] <yannickcrypto> YOU TRASH
[2023-04-09 19:15:50] <duoxehyon> YOU TRASH
[2023-04-09 19:15:53] <yannickcrypto> HEY
[2023-04-09 19:15:57] <duoxehyon> HAHA
[2023-04-09 20:43:03] <duoxehyon> holy shit 25k views
[2023-04-09 20:44:07] <duoxehyon> imo the best aggregator of aggregators onchain
[2023-04-09 20:51:02] <duoxehyon> yeah but for regular swaps its the best

[2023-06-15 01:39:33] <shunshow> bruhhhhh
[2023-06-15 01:39:38] <shunshow> bruh
[2023-06-15 01:40:05] <yannickcrypto> hacker verified his contract
[2023-06-15 01:40:32] <yannickcrypto> weird that he use SafeERC20 lib for transfer but use assembly to execute the exploit?
[2023-06-15 01:41:00] <stalkopat> probably to hide it?
[2023-06-15 01:42:30] <stalkopat> raises the barrier to hacky hack a bit by requiring people to either understand assembly or understand how to read tx traces
[2023-06-15 01:43:14] <yannickcrypto> or weird flex
[2023-06-15 01:43:32] <the0x> why are they allowing recovery without fee? is it a white hack?
[2023-06-15 01:43:46] <yannickcrypto> ya
[2023-06-15 01:43:49] <.sheero> yannick getting 5k views now wow
[2023-06-15 01:43:53] <yannickcrypto> YES
[2023-06-15 01:44:03] <stalkopat> probably entirely solves the legal question of is this whitehack legal?
[2023-06-15 01:44:06] <yannickcrypto> I NEED MORE CLOUT
[2023-06-15 01:44:26] <stalkopat> yannick you should've included the recoverWithDonate calldata aswell
[2023-06-15 01:44:47] <stalkopat> poor guy hasn't gotten a single Donation yet
[2023-06-15 01:44:52] <yannickcrypto> i wanted to name it recover() and recoverWithDonate()
[2023-06-15 01:44:56] <yannickcrypto> i knew he named the second function this way
[2023-06-15 01:45:03] <yannickcrypto> but was too lazy to confirm
[2023-06-15 01:45:27] <yannickcrypto> would be funny how he knew the function name before verified contract
[2023-06-15 01:45:28] <0xmiri> it feels good ngl
[2023-06-15 01:45:59] <yannickcrypto> he should have added a allowance check in recover
[2023-06-15 01:46:31] <optimcoder> tracking the contract to check who will donate
[2023-06-15 01:46:37] <stalkopat> maybe thats how he'll cover the tx fees and take his whitehat bounty after all
[2023-06-15 01:46:52] <stalkopat> Why would I be the hacker? I literally created the first whitehack with a withdraw function...
[2023-06-15 01:46:52] <the0x> is this the polygon version of the hack https://polygonscan.com/tx/0x19aabf945a5be9384219bb07677d8d33f5caf1c99b5dff5f3f0d85cb0e23ca33
[2023-06-15 01:47:19] <yannickcrypto> ya
[2023-06-15 01:47:23] <yannickcrypto> he got frontrunned ig
[2023-06-15 01:47:48] <stalkopat> Did he?
[2023-06-15 01:47:51] <ftx2> its same deployer
[2023-06-15 01:47:58] <ftx2> he also did it on arbi
[2023-06-15 01:48:15] <ftx2> avax and bsc

[2023-06-15 01:48:32] <yannickcrypto> no idea tbh
[2023-06-15 01:48:47] <stalkopat> This is how you should do (if you really feel a need to do it) a whitehat thing without contacting the protocol rescue on all chains and make a proper recover contract
[2023-06-15 01:48:51] <__reece__> Yannick sbf arc
[2023-06-15 01:49:08] <__reece__> Kind of crazy that he does ngl
[2023-06-15 01:49:36] <simdoes> how does one get a follow from sbf
[2023-06-15 01:49:52] <__reece__> Siphon funds
[2023-06-15 01:49:52] <yannickcrypto> i had a exploit in FTX withdraw system
[2023-06-15 01:49:57] <ftx2> nobody using the donate one 
[2023-06-15 01:50:11] <simdoes> goddamn
[2023-06-15 01:50:32] <stalkopat> next time just take 1/30'th of the biggest position and brag on twitter before doing anything else
[2023-06-15 01:51:11] <yannickcrypto> and get frontrunned and dont care about the 1000 other victims
[2023-06-15 01:52:35] <stalkopat> damn Polygon scamming competition is fierce

[2022-06-24 08:23:20] <inversebrah> Lmao did you send eth to the hacker?
[2022-06-24 08:23:33] <yannickcrypto> just a message
[2022-06-24 08:24:45] <inversebrah> That's like an advertisement lmao
[2022-06-24 08:25:21] <yannickcrypto> it is an ad 
[2022-06-24 08:25:59] <inversebrah> Also saw some protocols getting dns hacked
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2022-06-16 22:02:10] <vagabond2971> to hide IP?

[2023-10-13 21:42:19] <stalkopat> I'd be amazed if that one isn't a honeypot
[2023-10-13 21:42:51] <stalkopat> smithbots twitter is gone I think
[2023-10-13 21:43:37] <stalkopat> he talked about helping blackhats execute hacks safely by doing it himself returning 10% to the protocol and keeping the rest himself lmao

[2023-10-13 22:45:00] <seesoftware> you mean $12 million?
[2023-10-13 22:45:25] <0xevm_eth> More node peers and I mean good peers should help but latency will become an issue

[2023-10-13 22:46:16] <0xevm_eth> We had a call with them they explained so much stuff it’s incredible

[2023-10-13 22:47:41] <seesoftware> didnt help with anything
[2023-10-13 22:47:51] <0xevm_eth> But as we develop it’s gonna turn into HFT and will be based on latency
[2023-10-13 22:47:59] <0xevm_eth> What were your findings ?
[2023-10-13 22:49:05] <seesoftware> i just wanted to use that lower latency bsc tx submitting etc
[2023-10-13 22:49:15] <seesoftware> or private tx
[2023-10-13 22:49:19] <seesoftware> but it just made 0 difference
[2023-10-13 22:50:14] <0xevm_eth> Now that leads to my next question
[2023-10-13 22:50:50] <0xevm_eth> What builders sells your order flow to competition?
[2023-10-13 22:52:48] <seesoftware> idealy none

[2023-10-13 22:53:59] <0xevm_eth> I meant node endpoint provider I’m sure if your not netting them good money probably would sell your order flow who knows
[2023-10-13 22:55:07] <seesoftware> this why i host own nodes cant have trust issues with myself right?

[2023-10-15 19:20:32] <breeze.dev> fun brain teaser ```Useless (but surprising!) discovery today: you can't always encode a transaction's exact gas cost in its calldata.It's a bit of a chickenandegg problem as the encoding of the gas cost affects the gas cost itself but I had assumed there would always be some solution.

[2023-10-15 19:25:05] <breeze.dev> surely it's possible

[2023-10-15 19:53:34] <yannickcrypto> you ok?
[2023-10-15 19:57:52] <ripostex> i'm good now @Stalkopat found me a sln!
[2023-10-15 19:58:00] <ripostex> https://twitter.com/MevRefund/status/1713524415109923014
[2023-10-15 19:58:05] <ripostex> so deliciously gross
[2023-10-15 19:59:51] <yannickcrypto> i dont get it
[2023-10-15 20:03:05] <ripostex> the whole setup or just the sln?
[2023-10-15 20:16:10] <ripostex> want to tell a tx exactly what its gas cost is going to be
[2023-10-15 20:16:22] <ripostex> (can't really calc onchain because tx doesn't know about gas refunds)
[2023-10-15 20:16:36] <ripostex> so you reserve some section of calldata to encode the cost
[2023-10-15 20:16:51] <ripostex> you sim the tx with that section set to 0 and find the gas cost
[2023-10-15 20:17:30] <ripostex> you can set that gas cost in the calldata but of course that'll cost you a bit of extra gas so there's maybe some iterating to do
[2023-10-15 20:17:35] <ripostex> but had assumed there would be a solution
[2023-10-15 20:17:47] <ripostex> there is not always one
[2023-10-15 20:27:13] <ripostex> Yes all the tokens that I own you need to buy them and put them on your contract
[2023-10-15 20:27:17] <ripostex> No no you don't
[2023-10-15 20:38:35] <ripostex> I mean you have to set it to something. Your contract is expecting that bit of calldata to be gas cost
[2023-10-15 20:39:00] <ripostex> Doesn't have to be 0 if you want
[2023-10-15 20:40:09] <yannickcrypto> just set it to FFFFFF
[2023-10-15 20:40:57] <yannickcrypto> you could split it in 3 or 4 bytes and start counting from 1 instead of 0
[2023-10-15 20:42:12] <yannickcrypto> you can calculate all this stuff offchain (in case of 0 byte just substract)
[2023-10-15 20:42:15] <yannickcrypto> idk where problem is fren
[2023-10-15 20:47:52] <ripostex> problem is if you use the normal hex encoding there are some special gas cost values where (as in the example above) encoding the correct gas cost introduces a zero byte which changes the correct gas cost. So you wouldn\'t be able to encode the exact gas cost would have to fudge it a bit
[2023-10-15 20:57:21] <yannickcrypto> but you know that the zero byte gas deduction appear and can act
[2023-10-15 21:00:06] <yannickcrypto> 255 = 00ff256 = 0100when the gascost is 256 then u know this adds 12 gas because of the first byte so your total cost now is 268 gas
[2023-10-15 21:05:17] <seesoftware> both of these have the same cost though because both have a 0 byte
[2023-10-15 21:05:35] <yannickcrypto> oh eh
[2023-10-15 21:05:49] <yannickcrypto> 255 = 00ff257 = 0101when the gascost is 257 then u know this adds 12 gas because of the first byte so your total cost now is 269 gas
[2023-10-15 21:05:50] <seesoftware> just encode the byte 1255 and do some bitshifting on chain
[2023-10-15 21:05:51] <yannickcrypto> fixxed
[2023-10-15 21:06:00] <yannickcrypto> why encode just simulate
[2023-10-15 21:06:09] <yannickcrypto> dont even simulate just calculate it yourself
[2023-10-15 21:07:31] <seesoftware> on chain?
[2023-10-15 21:07:41] <yannickcrypto> why onchain you apss it in calldata
[2023-10-15 21:07:52] <seesoftware> but then it isnt exact anymore
[2023-10-15 21:08:09] <yannickcrypto> it is
[2023-10-15 21:08:25] <yannickcrypto> ^
[2023-10-15 21:08:40] <seesoftware> ic
[2023-10-15 21:08:49] <seesoftware> yea that can be done offchain and you have it correct then
[2023-10-15 21:08:52] <seesoftware> nice
[2023-10-15 21:09:08] <yannickcrypto> its not even a problem or do i miss something and misunderstand it?
[2023-10-15 21:09:10] <seesoftware> but what if fixing the value makes it cheaper again
[2023-10-15 21:09:24] <seesoftware> its just some esoteric problem
[2023-10-15 21:09:28] <seesoftware> doesnt have value
[2023-10-15 21:09:49] <yannickcrypto> i used a similar solution for my sandwichbot
[2023-10-15 21:10:35] <yannickcrypto> calculated all amounts in calldata and then tried to nullify some bytes
[2023-10-15 21:11:14] <yannickcrypto> if the swap out amount is 51564848947891784but51564848947891780have a 0 byte more then i decreased the swap out amount
[2023-10-15 21:11:16] <yannickcrypto> saved 12 gas
[2023-10-15 21:12:00] <seesoftware> you simmed 0x00ff gas but then you add 12 you have 0x010b which you have to add 12 again
[2023-10-15 21:12:25] <yannickcrypto> no?
[2023-10-15 21:13:26] <seesoftware> you start with 0x0000 in the calldata and the sim retuns gas used of 0x00ff so you try to put it into calldata so you add 12 to correct for it but then it rolls over
[2023-10-15 21:13:35] <seesoftware> so you have to add 12 again
[2023-10-15 21:14:03] <seesoftware> or add nothing if the least significat byte is 0 again
[2023-10-15 21:14:28] <seesoftware> but i guess you can just run the corrections until it stableizes
[2023-10-15 21:14:33] <seesoftware> so its no problem
[2023-10-15 21:15:54] <yannickcrypto> you sim gascost of 0x00ffthen you add this to your calldata (of 0x0000) gas cost increase by 12 gasgascost is now 0x010B but with another unnullified byte we have another 12 gas increase so your total addition is 24 gas and results in calldata 0x0117 and gascost of 279 gas
[2023-10-15 21:16:22] <seesoftware> ya
[2023-10-15 21:16:42] <yannickcrypto> https://tenor.com/view/sowhichpartistheproblemkanangillsowhatstheproblemtellmetheproblemwhatpartofitistheproblemgif24001727
[2023-10-15 21:17:02] <seesoftware> was just trying to point out that multiple corrections were necessary sometimes
[2023-10-15 21:17:05] <seesoftware> so no problem
[2023-10-15 21:17:20] <seesoftware> tweet is wrong
[2023-10-15 21:17:56] <yannickcrypto> lets bully him
[2023-10-15 21:22:07] <yannickcrypto> worst case its 1 correction best case 0
[2023-10-15 21:22:36] <seesoftware> you just said that needs 2 corrections? so worst case 2
[2023-10-15 21:23:06] <yannickcrypto> first step you dont need
[2023-10-15 21:23:13] <yannickcrypto> because it always min. +12 gas
[2023-10-15 21:23:44] <stalkopat> There can be cases where it doesn't converge its possible that adding 12 gas (from non zero to zero) adds a zero byte at the first indexed byte now you reiterate and lower gas by 12 again but that puts you back into the inital state
[2023-10-15 21:23:51] <ripostex> Run my example above!
[2023-10-15 21:24:40] <ripostex> Though where you getting 4? 4 for 0 16 for nonzero
[2023-10-15 21:25:05] <stalkopat> Oh is it 4? Thought zero was 12 either way problem idea is the same
[2023-10-15 21:25:38] <stalkopat> Its indeed 4 nvm
[2023-10-15 21:25:59] <yannickcrypto> will be never the case when you simulate with blank calldata
[2023-10-15 21:26:21] <ripostex> Run my example please
[2023-10-15 21:26:29] <yannickcrypto> i dont understand your example
[2023-10-15 21:26:30] <yannickcrypto> 0 6?
[2023-10-15 21:26:32] <yannickcrypto> 1 6?
[2023-10-15 21:26:54] <yannickcrypto> ??????
[2023-10-15 21:27:04] <ripostex> Assumed nonzeroes actual nonzeroes
[2023-10-15 21:27:09] <stalkopat> This is a purely mathematical example what you sim doesn't affect this problem this all happens during encoding not during simming
[2023-10-15 21:27:24] <yannickcrypto> give me a gascost number where it does not work
[2023-10-15 21:28:12] <ripostex> 100019 gas used when encoding all zeroes
[2023-10-15 21:28:20] <yannickcrypto> what u mean encoding all zeroes
[2023-10-15 21:28:27] <ripostex> With a gas price of 10 gwei
[2023-10-15 21:28:40] <yannickcrypto> why with gas price of 10 gwei
[2023-10-15 21:28:50] <yannickcrypto> that information isnt neccesary for our problem
[2023-10-15 21:29:03] <ripostex> The first sim when you don't know the gas cost
[2023-10-15 21:29:12] <yannickcrypto> with 0000 calldat?
[2023-10-15 21:29:16] <ripostex> It is encoding gas cost not gas used
[2023-10-15 21:29:29] <yannickcrypto> https://tenor.com/view/eyerollughstanleyrollseyesgif9403428
[2023-10-15 21:29:37] <ripostex> Yes though need more than 2 bytes
[2023-10-15 21:29:40] <stalkopat> Pretty sure this doesn't affect the underlying problem
[2023-10-15 21:29:49] <yannickcrypto> it does not
[2023-10-15 21:29:59] <yannickcrypto> it just add complexity
[2023-10-15 21:30:05] <ripostex> Sure but it's my only example 
[2023-10-15 21:32:25] <yannickcrypto> well then choose a proper example
[2023-10-15 21:33:15] <ripostex> Way too lazy gave you a working example
[2023-10-15 21:33:19] <yannickcrypto> too lazy to calculate with this big ass numbers
[2023-10-15 21:33:27] <yannickcrypto> i gave you a working example too
[2023-10-15 21:33:38] <ripostex> Don't worry I did it for you already 
[2023-10-15 21:34:12] <yannickcrypto> same
[2023-10-15 21:34:46] <ripostex> Plenty of working examples  didn't say it never works just sometimes it doesnt
[2023-10-15 21:37:33] <yannickcrypto> oh yeah now i see it
[2023-10-15 21:37:45] <yannickcrypto> it is because of your multiplication with gas cost
[2023-10-15 21:38:14] <yannickcrypto> but multiply with gas cost is a unneccesary step
[2023-10-15 21:40:00] <yannickcrypto> my solution always work because you just add 12 gas this cant swap two bytes 0 or from 0 to &gt;0
[2023-10-15 21:40:45] <stalkopat> Of course it can imagine lowest byte being at 243
[2023-10-15 21:41:20] <stalkopat> You add 12 and it overflows back to 0
[2023-10-15 21:42:15] <stalkopat> This saves you 12 gas if the byte above it doesn't also overflow
[2023-10-15 21:42:23] <stalkopat> Which means you now encode 12 gas less
[2023-10-15 21:42:24] <yannickcrypto> ```243 new calldata F3 prev calldata 00 +12 gas255 new calldata FF prev calldata E3 +0 gassolved```
[2023-10-15 21:42:41] <stalkopat> 244 then
[2023-10-15 21:42:50] <yannickcrypto> ```243 new calldata F3 prev calldata 00 +12 gas255 new calldata FF prev calldata E3 +0 gassolved```
[2023-10-15 21:43:14] <yannickcrypto> 0xFF is the gas cost of a simulation with 243 gas and 00 calldata
[2023-10-15 21:44:48] <stalkopat> Try with 244
[2023-10-15 21:45:19] <stalkopat> Actually with 0x01F4
[2023-10-15 21:46:20] <yannickcrypto> ```244 new calldata 00F4 prev calldata 0000 +12 gas256 new calldata 0100 prev calldata 00F4 +00x0100 is the gascost of a simulation with 244 gas (+12 gas) and 00 calldata```
[2023-10-15 21:46:39] <yannickcrypto> solved
[2023-10-15 21:46:59] <stalkopat> No I said 0x01F4
[2023-10-15 21:47:02] <ripostex> 0x1F4
[2023-10-15 21:47:09] <yannickcrypto> ?
[2023-10-15 21:47:10] <ripostex> So you don't gain a byte
[2023-10-15 21:47:17] <yannickcrypto> whats now
[2023-10-15 21:47:26] <stalkopat> .
[2023-10-15 21:47:33] <yannickcrypto> 500?
[2023-10-15 21:48:09] <stalkopat> No clue about decimal i'm on mobile lmao
[2023-10-15 21:48:21] <ripostex> Yes
[2023-10-15 21:48:25] <stalkopat> 500 sounds about right tho
[2023-10-15 21:48:49] <yannickcrypto> ```500 new calldata 01F4 prev calldata 0000 +24 gas524 new calldata 020C prev calldata 01F4 +0 gas0x020C is the gascost of a simulation with 500 gas (+24 gas) and 0000 calldata```
[2023-10-15 21:49:08] <yannickcrypto> you trolling me?
[2023-10-15 21:49:10] <ripostex> shit subtract 12
[2023-10-15 21:49:14] <yannickcrypto> want to waste my time?
[2023-10-15 21:49:33] <ripostex> See that's why I didn't want to come up with another example!
[2023-10-15 21:49:36] <yannickcrypto> use this format to proof me wrong
[2023-10-15 21:49:41] <yannickcrypto> its bulletproof
[2023-10-15 21:49:55] <ripostex> Fine give me a sec
[2023-10-15 21:49:59] <yannickcrypto> gogo
[2023-10-15 21:50:06] <yannickcrypto> i dont accept gascost anymore
[2023-10-15 21:50:13] <yannickcrypto> ^ do the calculation yourself
[2023-10-15 21:50:53] <ripostex> Yeah 488
[2023-10-15 21:50:56] <ripostex> Final answer
[2023-10-15 21:51:14] <yannickcrypto> do it yourself
[2023-10-15 21:51:24] <ripostex> I did
[2023-10-15 21:51:28] <yannickcrypto> show me
[2023-10-15 21:51:32] <ripostex> Sigh
[2023-10-15 21:52:04] <ripostex> 488 &gt; 0x1E8
[2023-10-15 21:52:17] <yannickcrypto> show me your calculation
[2023-10-15 21:52:48] <ripostex> +24 gas &gt; 512 &gt; 0x200
[2023-10-15 21:53:11] <ripostex> which only uses 12 gas
[2023-10-15 21:53:46] <ripostex> But if we try encoding 500 it has 2 nonzero bytes so it doesn't work either
[2023-10-15 21:53:51] <ripostex> There's no solution
[2023-10-15 21:54:04] <yannickcrypto> ```488 01E8 0000 +24512 0200 01E8 12500 01F4 0200 +12512 0200 01F4 12```

[2023-10-15 21:57:12] <yannickcrypto> this could be fixable with a second parameter like an boolean
[2023-10-15 21:57:33] <yannickcrypto> if this case happens switch this boolean from 00 to 01

[2023-10-15 22:00:00] <ripostex> Nice even cleaner than the horrible base 15 encoding
[2023-10-15 22:00:30] <yannickcrypto> base 15 encoding is 0x01 to 0x0F and no 00 anymore?
[2023-10-15 22:00:36] <ripostex> Yep
[2023-10-15 22:00:43] <ripostex> Have fun implementing that in SC

[2023-10-15 22:01:32] <yannickcrypto> lookks terrible
[2023-10-15 22:02:07] <yannickcrypto> i wanted to finish lot of stuff today
[2023-10-15 22:02:35] <yannickcrypto> woke up 8am ate two sandwiches (rip sandwichbot) then slept again to 2pm now its 4pm i eat lasagne and i gonna take a nap again
[2023-10-15 22:02:56] <yannickcrypto> everything i did was try to solve your gascost thing lol
[2023-10-15 22:06:19] <seesoftware> ```rustfn main() { fn value_cost(i: i32) &gt; i32 { let bytes = (i as u16).to_be_bytes(); let zero_bytes = bytes.iter().filter(|x|x==0).count(); let non_zero_bytes = bytes.len()  zero_bytes; (zero_bytes  4 + non_zero_bytes  16).try_into().unwrap() } fn cost_with_value(base: i32 gas: i32) &gt; i32 { base + value_cost(gas)  value_cost(0x0000) } for sim_gas_used in 0 ..= 0xFFFFi32 { let mut actual_gas_cost = cost_with_value(sim_gas_used sim_gas_used); let mut call_value = cost_with_value(sim_gas_used actual_gas_cost); // try correct value if call_value != actual_gas_cost { actual_gas_cost = call_value; call_value = cost_with_value(sim_gas_used actual_gas_cost); } // value still wrong if call_value != actual_gas_cost { println!("{:#04x} sim_gas_used); } }}``` so i wrote this for nothing atlest this one prints all the impossible to encode values

[2023-10-14 19:32:35] <lebotflasher_96454> Hello everyone!Sorry if I'm posting this one the wrong channel but this one felt like the correct one I was taking a look at some arbitrages on eigenphi and came across this one: https://eigenphi.io/mev/eigentx/multi/0xf56e7a65a4cc396f1dfe970a0655ae2310073cb068513234c5c995cb2104490f,0xe1d153bbc0467c0bdd2dae7163ff7b6a9769ae235cce8a990dcf09b18a4b06f0The signal injects WETH into a uniswap v3 pool and extracts NATI but the bot also injects WETH into the same pool while arbitraging with a v2 poolI'm wondering if the bot had done the arbitrage without the signal wouldn't they have made a bigger profit ?The signal rate was 1 weth to 13352477881.783498938467388141 NATI and the bot's rate was 1 weth to 13165705999.454565072056272093 NATI the bot got less NATI for the same amount of WETHIf the bot had done the arbitrage without the signal (so they'd be using the signal's rate for themselves) they would have made a profit of 0.224933205142284034 instead of 0.221786882901973897 that's 0.003146322240310137 more WETHAnyone know if there's a logical reason to use the signal or maybe the bot is just reactive on mempool txs and didn't even bother to simulate the arbitrage without the signal ?
[2023-10-15 07:05:29] <lebotflasher_96454> Contabo is nice and cheap

[2023-10-15 20:37:25] <yannickcrypto> why you have to set it to 0
[2023-10-15 20:40:22] <yannickcrypto> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[2023-10-15 20:41:42] <yannickcrypto> well no
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2023-10-15 21:45:32] <stalkopat> That should overflow the lower byte to 0 and keep the upper non zero
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2023-10-15 22:06:45] <seesoftware> which is just every value &gt; 0x100 that has a 0xe8 as the least significat byte
[2023-10-15 22:07:09] <seesoftware> wanted to do this in python but then was like how do i make a for loop and then gave up
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2023-10-15 22:22:38] <breeze.dev> same shit happened to me

[2023-10-16 02:19:12] <ripostex> pretty much just verbosity 1
[2023-10-16 02:19:14] <ripostex> super weird
[2023-10-16 04:30:07] <lebotflasher_96454> But the gas is only refunded on self destruct SSTORE[x] = 0 and reverts right ?So if you don't do any of that by the end of your contract why worry about it ?
[2023-10-16 06:12:08] <ripostex> Oops that's a lie all the ones without `gcmode archive` have just 3
[2023-10-16 06:13:00] <ripostex> Pretty much any mucking about with strorage will usually end up issuing a refund
[2023-10-16 07:15:46] <shunshow> Have you tried turning the node off and look for something else to do with your life
[2023-10-16 07:16:44] <shunshow> Plenty of possibilities out there like Amazon arbitrage chicken Mac nugget arbitrage plane pieces arbitrage

[2023-10-15 23:40:09] <lebotflasher_96454> So why can't we use gasLeft() and the start and end of the contract execution + a bit more to know the gas used and instead have to pass the gas in the calldata from a simulated call ?

[2023-10-17 02:12:57] <seesoftware> dont forget about storage changes that other contracts do that you call from your contract

[2023-10-17 06:31:53] <pandakk> Wdym bro it is plug and play. I just deploy a contract on remix that I found in a pastebin in YouTube comments and send some eth to it. Then instant money gets teleported to my wallet!

[2023-10-17 07:24:14] <santoshinakamoto> You mean drained from your wallet?
[2023-10-17 08:52:33] <araka8765> Is there a way to get next coinbase address ahead of block generation?
[2023-10-17 08:52:43] <mteam88> no thats impossible (:

[2023-10-17 08:53:57] <mteam88> &gt; ## Random selection&gt; A single validator is pseudorandomly chosen to propose a block in each slot. There is no such thing as true randomness in a blockchain because if each node generated genuinely random numbers they couldn't come to consensus. Instead the aim is to make the validator selection process unpredictable. The randomness is achieved on Ethereum using an algorithm called RANDAO that mixes a hash from the block proposer with a seed that gets updated every block.
[2023-10-17 08:54:34] <mteam88> the aim is to make the validator selection process unpredictable. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2023-10-17 11:48:13] <nervoir> It’s very likely coinbase will be one of four values.
[2023-10-17 11:51:29] <nervoir> You can pick which one by sending a bundle that pays the coinbase you want with a call/transfer only if coinbase is what you want. The amount needed will be rather tiny.

[2023-10-17 16:32:04] <tonyke> friends what's your current size of an erigon ETH fullnode?
[2023-10-17 17:02:17] <yannickcrypto> 2.3 tb for archive node and 700gb with purge &gt;10k old blocks

[2023-10-18 04:17:16] <optimcoder> advantages?
[2023-10-18 04:42:23] <0xevm_eth> Did any one see this

[2023-10-18 04:46:19] <0xevm_eth> I’m just trying to understand how
[2023-10-18 04:46:51] <0xevm_eth> Was it arbitrage then sandwich or pure sandwich? Because flashloans are very expensive when it comes to gas
[2023-10-18 04:46:57] <yannickcrypto> pure sandwich
[2023-10-18 04:47:19] <0xevm_eth> It’s not common is it ?
[2023-10-18 04:47:23] <0xevm_eth> First time I’ve seen one
[2023-10-18 04:47:27] <0xevm_eth> Well for me anyways
[2023-10-18 04:47:29] <yannickcrypto> its not a common sandwich
[2023-10-18 04:49:09] <seesoftware> oh so its like normal sandwich but the guy leveraged his funds so he could sandwich more
[2023-10-18 04:50:51] <yannickcrypto> borrow 7300 ETH from balancersupple it to aaveborrow ETH again?swap to USDCsupply the USDC to aavewithdraw most of the ETH and repay balancer
[2023-10-18 04:51:17] <yannickcrypto> swap to USDC &lt; here he max slipped foundation
[2023-10-18 04:51:23] <seesoftware> might be able to get couple x leverage without risk for one block
[2023-10-18 04:52:02] <yannickcrypto> oh ya
[2023-10-18 04:52:05] <yannickcrypto> well reorg protection
[2023-10-18 04:53:06] <yannickcrypto> this bot dont care about gas
[2023-10-18 04:53:13] <yannickcrypto> contract is written in solidity
[2023-10-18 04:53:26] <yannickcrypto> btw its the same sandwichbot that got hacked from the lowcarbcrusader 25m theft
[2023-10-18 04:53:52] <seesoftware> karma
[2023-10-18 04:53:59] <yannickcrypto> i hate him

[2023-10-18 04:54:17] <0xevm_eth> He was waiting for them Lool
[2023-10-18 04:54:28] <yannickcrypto> before PoS and jared my contract was 10k MORE GAS OPTIMIZED and i paid MORE BRIBE and i still lost most opps

[2023-10-18 04:55:01] <stalkopat> cope
[2023-10-18 04:55:06] <seesoftware> 4
[2023-10-18 04:55:09] <yannickcrypto> aaand blocked
[2023-10-18 04:55:31] <yannickcrypto> he was sweating when he added reaction
[2023-10-18 04:56:01] <seesoftware> yannick added block button next to the name for quick access
[2023-10-18 04:56:09] <yannickcrypto> i was just joking fren
[2023-10-18 04:56:20] <seesoftware> ya mee too 
[2023-10-18 04:56:26] <yannickcrypto> wow relax!
[2023-10-18 04:56:32] <stalkopat> wut can't you react to ppl you blocked?
[2023-10-18 04:56:55] <seesoftware> nop and if you open profile it just says cant load info or something like that
[2023-10-18 04:57:05] <yannickcrypto> oh ya
[2023-10-18 04:57:23] <yannickcrypto> well 9k slipped while swapping $2.7m
[2023-10-18 04:57:34] <yannickcrypto> foundation didnt even notice it
[2023-10-18 04:57:42] <stalkopat> that seems... stupid why would it give someone that you blocked any indication that they are blocked
[2023-10-18 04:57:52] <yannickcrypto> how should he know that he is blocked?
[2023-10-18 04:58:07] <stalkopat> I mean someone can just check if they can react?
[2023-10-18 04:58:26] <yannickcrypto> ya but 99% of the case when you block someone you want to upset him
[2023-10-18 04:58:35] <seesoftware> thats only 2x of what uniswap would have gotten with their frontend fee 
[2023-10-18 05:00:07] <yannickcrypto> this mf realy dont want to get reorged lmao
[2023-10-18 05:00:16] <yannickcrypto> timestamp AND blockhash check
[2023-10-18 05:00:49] <seesoftware> which doesnt actually protect shit?
[2023-10-18 05:01:01] <stalkopat> it does wym
[2023-10-18 05:01:03] <yannickcrypto> timestamp is enough
[2023-10-18 05:01:07] <seesoftware> reorg has same parent and block number

[2023-10-18 05:01:41] <seesoftware> oh
[2023-10-18 05:01:44] <seesoftware> i read block number rip
[2023-10-18 05:02:15] <yannickcrypto> oo
[2023-10-18 05:02:53] <seesoftware> less safe than timestamp == x due to possible hash collision 
[2023-10-18 05:03:23] <yannickcrypto> waaaaait
[2023-10-18 05:03:40] <yannickcrypto> he just check the first 4 bytes of the hash so it should be possible to find collision
[2023-10-18 05:03:59] <seesoftware> ye but would still be a long ass time since thats 1/4 bil
[2023-10-18 05:04:26] <yannickcrypto> block 1000 he get reorgedblock 1001 you mine and find a collision with blockhash (current_time + 12)block 1002 you mine again and unbundle him
[2023-10-18 05:05:53] <seesoftware> i dont think you have to mine blocks at all

[2023-10-18 06:28:57] <mic8007> Hello I am having some problems with a bundle I\'m trying to submit. I always get the bundle hash but it never actually get included and I am using more than enough fees. This is how I am constructing it:```signer = ...tx1 = { \'chainId\': 1 \'type\': 2 \'to\': \'0x...\ \'value\': 85879237723674000 \'gas\': 21000 \'maxFeePerGas\': 6100629634606 \'maxPriorityFeePerGas\': 6054020802016 \'nonce\': 4}tx2 = { ... } # similar to tx1token_tx = { \'chainId\': 1 \'type\': 2 \'to\': \'0x...\ \'data\': \'0x....\ \'nonce\': 4 \'gas\': 70000 \'maxFeePerGas\': 2680000128 \'maxPriorityFeePerGas\': 0}```token_tx[\'data\'] is the abiencoded version of something like this:```{ name": transfer params": [ { name": _to value": 0x... type": address } { name": _value value": 148000000 type": uint256 } ]}```And finally the bundle:```bundle = [ {\'signer\': signer \'transaction\': tx1} {\'signer\': signer \'transaction\': tx2} {\'signer\': signer \'transaction\': token_tx}]```If some builder can help me I can provide you my bundle hashes. I really don\'t understand what\'s wrong with it.

[2023-10-18 23:49:33] <yannickcrypto> when do we frontrun exploits with 99% bribe
[2023-10-18 23:57:42] <yannickcrypto> why mev bot sending fees too
[2023-10-18 23:58:59] <yannickcrypto> HEY

[2023-10-18 23:45:17] <ani9040> Yeah i was thinking it must be super cheap considering how common it is
[2023-10-18 23:49:21] <yannickcrypto> frontrunning bribe already at 50% lel
[2023-10-18 23:57:29] <yannickcrypto> dont you said the fees are just in the frontend?

[2023-10-18 23:59:57] <the0x> why would the bot choose to do that
[2023-10-19 00:02:50] <yannickcrypto> isnt it a hook?
[2023-10-19 00:02:59] <yannickcrypto> so there is no way around fees
[2023-10-19 00:03:57] <yannickcrypto> aaaaaa

[2023-10-19 02:32:49] <crypt0pat> How you find it some sort of scan or active reconnaissance
[2023-10-19 02:33:16] <yannickcrypto> someone asked me to look into it
[2023-10-19 02:34:47] <crypt0pat> Ohh ok well it served you very well so that’s good

[2023-10-19 02:56:55] <alfalafels> If anyone else has some mev they want someone to look into and yannick is unavailable consider sending to me or seesoftware and we can take a look at how to execute (including an example tx on mainnet)
[2023-10-19 02:58:28] <seesoftware> example is important so the person can learn 
[2023-10-19 02:59:18] <0xevm_eth> and when your done you can send it through my rpc i have special relationships with titan and rsync guaranteed inclusion

[2023-10-19 03:43:29] <ani9040> I sent yannick a sandwich strat making 3040 ETH a month earlier this year and he didn't want it 
[2023-10-19 03:44:02] <ani9040> now the guy stopped though so maybe it really did suck
[2023-10-19 03:44:57] <yannickcrypto> sandwich is illegal
[2023-10-19 03:45:15] <ani9040> true

[2023-10-19 03:45:40] <ani9040> he made another 114
[2023-10-19 03:45:46] <ani9040> after I sent to u
[2023-10-19 03:47:13] <ani9040> wait fk I math wrong
[2023-10-19 03:47:18] <ani9040> nvm he sux
[2023-10-19 03:48:26] <ani9040> 114 ETH in 8 months but probably not making much towards the end
[2023-10-19 05:32:31] <_yascha> on god is out there sniping again
[2023-10-19 05:36:23] <.sheero> who is that

[2023-10-19 05:45:03] <santoshinakamoto> how much are the mev players here making on average? isnt doing a daytime coding job better in pay
[2023-10-19 05:46:41] <santoshinakamoto> that is decent but a five year experience good software engineer in the bay area would typically make north of 400k/year.
[2023-10-19 05:47:55] <breeze.dev> yea but does he make friends along the way?

[2023-10-19 07:24:31] <yannickcrypto> a 10 year experienced good software engineer earns in germany 80k
[2023-10-19 07:31:04] <yannickcrypto> germany?
[2023-10-19 07:31:09] <shunshow> Berlin
[2023-10-19 07:31:13] <yannickcrypto> wooooooot
[2023-10-19 07:31:17] <shunshow> In a big company
[2023-10-19 07:31:43] <yannickcrypto> doxxed
[2023-10-19 07:31:51] <shunshow> Germany pays very well I think among the best in europe
[2023-10-19 07:31:53] <the0x> that's kinda rought in US you start at 120
[2023-10-19 07:32:05] <yannickcrypto> na
[2023-10-19 07:32:59] <shunshow> It's pretty different in the US cost of living is higher there and you don't get money after you retire no?
[2023-10-19 07:33:13] <the0x> yes you do social security exists
[2023-10-19 07:33:15] <the0x> similar to europe
[2023-10-19 07:33:30] <stalkopat> &gt; you don't get money after you retire no?As if any of us will ever see any of that $ lmao
[2023-10-19 07:34:09] <shunshow> We will debt will be at 1 quadrillion but who cares am I right
[2023-10-19 07:34:21] <yannickcrypto> yup cost of living explains why you earn 120k in US but just 50k in europe
[2023-10-19 07:34:24] <yannickcrypto> looooooooooool
[2023-10-19 07:34:29] <yannickcrypto> 70k more expenses in usa
[2023-10-19 07:35:09] <shunshow> Doomed to be europoor
[2023-10-19 07:35:19] <stalkopat> US pays SWE's like twice what EU pays
[2023-10-19 07:35:23] <stalkopat> and probably has a 10x higher ceiling
[2023-10-19 07:35:30] <the0x> that's a lot of hang waving for europeans it's actually not that much more expensive tbh
[2023-10-19 07:35:58] <the0x> the pay easily outruns the cost of living by multiples
[2023-10-19 07:36:12] <shunshow> Yeah but you get to live in America
[2023-10-19 07:36:21] <the0x> that's a serious downside for sure
[2023-10-19 07:36:26] <yannickcrypto> thats not even worth a 10m job
[2023-10-19 07:58:34] <sham789> Guys whoever here tried simulating tx via REVM ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2023-10-19 07:30:51] <shunshow> Cap I was at 70k 2 years and a half after start
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2023-10-19 07:58:57] <sham789> This channel replaces Twitter sometimes
[2023-10-19 08:18:39] <pandakk> For a job in tech living in the bay area outpaces anywhere else on the planet
[2023-10-19 08:28:22] <sham789> I did it and I have some questions
[2023-10-19 10:59:20] <wjmelements> Also they don’t have atwill employment. I tried hiring a Czech but they have a law there saying if the contractor is actually an employee then you owe back taxes and also after they stop working for you you have to pay them until they get a new job.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2023-10-19 08:45:41] <the0x> we do
[2023-10-19 10:19:31] <_yascha> wow that is really low

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2023-10-19 16:19:10] <chandras> I really feel sorry for myself with all these numbers of pay even after 20 years of IT not even making 50k Per year
[2023-10-19 18:12:53] <seesoftware> wow thats so good!! im making 35k a year before tax (although to be fair i have not really tried at all to improve that) (and is in eu)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2023-10-19 18:05:39] <slv6649> What's the difference between sending fees to the builderspecific fee recipient vs sending to coinbase? Do I need to use both?
[2023-10-19 18:08:07] <paulscreen> well you're in the right discord to resolve that 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2023-10-19 18:39:19] <lailailailai> that's not even enough for rent

[2023-10-19 18:44:32] <seesoftware> some time ago it was more than that but in recent times its maybe ~samey maybe less. need to find new alpha
[2023-10-19 18:45:44] <optimcoder> Good better or nothing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2023-10-19 18:57:32] <yannickcrypto> how something can be less than 0?
[2023-10-19 18:57:59] <seesoftware> when you pay more then you get 
[2023-10-19 18:58:15] <breeze.dev> only $35K per year?
[2023-10-19 18:58:25] <breeze.dev> I'm making $20 million per year before bribe
[2023-10-19 18:58:45] <breeze.dev> thats a lil over $113,000

[2023-10-19 19:51:13] <sheldonholmgren> Watching my liquidation bot score its hits is fun but I don't feel like implementing similar logic for another lending protocol. For my next trick I will do some DEX arbitrage. I will target L2s because gas optimisation at EVM assembly level doesn't sound like fun
[2023-10-19 19:57:43] <yannickcrypto> It is fun fren
[2023-10-19 19:58:58] <sheldonholmgren> Too much learning for me. I'm hungry for some quicker rewards. Perhaps once I make more money I will hire someone to do the EVM assembly stuff
[2023-10-19 20:04:40] <seesoftware> so much cheaper to deploy than solitidy too 
[2023-10-19 20:05:03] <seesoftware> i dont understand where the bytecode bloat comes from
[2023-10-19 20:05:19] <seesoftware> ik it has like metadata but its only a 32byte hash of it no?
[2023-10-19 20:09:17] <yannickcrypto> Hire me for 250€/h
[2023-10-19 20:09:30] <ripostex> &gt; I will target L2slol and you think gas optimisation takes work?! Enjoy the never ending latency battles fren
[2023-10-19 20:09:50] <yannickcrypto> Or 4.5€ per gas reduced against a solidity contract
[2023-10-19 20:10:23] <seesoftware> oh shit daymn quick millioner

[2023-10-19 21:59:39] <simdoes> when using geth debug_traceCall callTracer w/ withLog set to true sometimes it returns logs property with list of logs and then sometimes it puts the logs into the calls array like calls: [from: ... to: ... logs: [...]]
[2023-10-19 21:59:44] <simdoes> am I missing something?
[2023-10-19 22:00:49] <simdoes> maybe the depth 0 frame put its logs in logs property and the logs from other call logs get put into their own objects is what I'm guessing
[2023-10-19 22:56:54] <simdoes> withLog
[2023-10-19 23:22:57] <simdoes> wdym not geth standard
[2023-10-19 23:23:02] <simdoes> it's in the geth docs 
[2023-10-20 00:16:54] <wjmelements> Well it “protected” them from being employed in the first place
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2023-10-19 22:25:00] <sham789> Logs aren’t part of tracing via callTracer
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2023-10-19 22:57:40] <the0x> this is not geth standard
[2023-10-19 22:58:26] <the0x> write your own tracer @SimDoes it's the way
[2023-10-19 23:23:48] <the0x> My bad I didn’t know!
[2023-10-20 01:00:00] <sheldonholmgren> It is fun fren. I worked in a top HFT shop before this
[2023-10-20 01:10:47] <sheldonholmgren> I did code4rena/sherlock/immunefi before MEV. I heard about MEV while learning about ethereum in general
[2023-10-20 01:12:36] <sheldonholmgren> Currently liquidations on one niche lending protocol. I'm now writing an arbitrage bot. I'm still figuring out what I like the most in this space. For now it's still just fooling around.
[2023-10-20 01:18:24] <sheldonholmgren> But that would apply only if you are also based/incorporated in Czechia right?
[2023-10-20 01:20:21] <sheldonholmgren> Too much office politics and other bullshit. I hit my financial independence goal so now I can do latency battles for fun.

[2023-10-20 00:38:19] <_yascha> union president complaining about worker protections 
[2023-10-20 01:00:18] <breeze.dev> we are all wagees/wagie waiting for the wagie/wagee to deposit his money into defi
[2023-10-20 01:00:57] <breeze.dev> i just wanna be a wagmi
[2023-10-20 01:01:48] <breeze.dev> tfw the union prez was typing a long message but all that came out was ngmi
[2023-10-20 01:02:09] <breeze.dev> what strategy are you into?
[2023-10-20 01:02:11] <breeze.dev> how did you discover mev?
[2023-10-20 01:18:11] <vehctor> shoulda stayed at that hft shop
[2023-10-20 01:21:47] <vehctor> latency battle on l2's ? Look into dog park
[2023-10-20 01:25:55] <alfalafels> what is the difference between nft and hft?
[2023-10-20 01:29:16] <yannickcrypto> There is no difference
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2023-10-20 00:47:39] <wjmelements> Are there wagees in this channel?
[2023-10-20 00:54:45] <wjmelements> apparently it’s spelled wagie
[2023-10-20 01:01:14] <wjmelements> ngmi
[2023-10-20 01:01:51] <breeze.dev> burns.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2023-10-20 01:37:59] <simdoes> HFT as in high frequency trading?
[2023-10-20 01:38:22] <sham789> high fungible token
[2023-10-20 01:38:26] <seesoftware> no harry potter sonic 10 inu fungable token
[2023-10-20 01:41:24] <simdoes> good ol flashbots discord
[2023-10-20 01:43:49] <_yascha> HFT as in happy fun time
[2023-10-20 01:44:53] <wjmelements> No; they are especially strict about foreign employers
[2023-10-20 02:01:51] <sheldonholmgren> Uhm... but what do you care? If you and your company are not residents there their laws don't apply to you. How would they enforce that? If Myanmar suddenly decides that every person in the world owes them $10 in taxes nobody is going to pay.
[2023-10-20 03:18:42] <santoshinakamoto> Dont fk with EU
[2023-10-20 03:31:24] <wjmelements> hmm why does Facebook pay the EU

[2023-10-20 07:54:27] <chandras> Hi Guys GM
[2023-10-20 07:55:07] <chandras> Been listening and reading a lot these days just came across the term mempool nodes is it the same ranger relay that Rjected built?? or something different??
[2023-10-20 09:29:57] <ripostex> Kept 2.5% meh could've been worse
[2023-10-20 09:30:30] <stalkopat> He bribed over 99% i'm pretty sure
[2023-10-20 09:30:43] <ripostex> 2.5% for the whole block
[2023-10-20 09:31:58] <stalkopat> Not searcher builder I don't think?
[2023-10-20 09:32:23] <stalkopat> Sends to all sorts of other builders
[2023-10-20 09:33:51] <ripostex> Is their bot 0x5e5 then?
[2023-10-20 09:33:59] <ripostex> They're tagged in my head as a searcherbuilder
[2023-10-20 09:34:28] <ripostex> https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf5f946feaee1ec510a150e255303911e38d287cc0c26b0b64567fc8449e148ff
[2023-10-20 09:35:05] <stalkopat> 0x5e51328C0583094b76f28Cfd532AbC3d454fCfEA sends exclusively to ethbuilder
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2023-10-20 05:46:02] <quantaraum> so i have a working strategy and simulating the results locally. Now i have done some bundles with my own txns but how do i include a mempool txn to the bundle? what data do i have to include from the mempool txn?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2023-10-20 08:42:09] <_yascha> Gross bribe https://etherscan.io/tx/0x322765dad340a723c93b3a5f4af6783a2e7f6c23856c0a54142246eb9c986ed3
[2023-10-20 08:42:43] <the0x> `ethbuilder` really?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2023-10-20 09:12:19] <snoopy> high or low?

[2023-10-20 09:46:44] <_yascha> i'm just here for the stalko riposte back and forth
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2023-10-20 11:20:01] <araka8765> 5 dex arb's bribe is around 98%
[2023-10-20 11:20:10] <araka8765> 4 dex arb's bribe is 99%
[2023-10-20 11:46:29] <sheldonholmgren> 1. They have entities registered in virtually every country. 2. They are big enough that it makes sense to create legislation tailormade to make them comnply.
[2023-10-20 11:49:29] <sheldonholmgren> I don't believe you spoke to a lawyer in you jurisdiction and they told you that you would be liable for Czech taxes.
[2023-10-20 19:08:54] <sheldonholmgren> Yuck! DEX Arb is so much math. I think I will go back to my beloved liquidations
[2023-10-20 19:11:53] <breeze.dev> atleast you only need to liquidate on the way up
[2023-10-20 19:11:56] <breeze.dev> because bull market
[2023-10-20 19:12:04] <breeze.dev> https://tenor.com/view/allthewayupshirlenekingpearsonmsjuicycameopointingupgif17900552
[2023-10-20 19:34:00] <shunshow> Why price go up did dev do something
[2023-10-20 19:46:46] <sheldonholmgren> Well X/Y going up means Y/X is going down
[2023-10-20 19:46:59] <breeze.dev> yes exactly
[2023-10-20 19:47:40] <breeze.dev> today it could be dollars dropping in value thus things require more dollars to buy
[2023-10-20 19:47:56] <breeze.dev> which makes sense considering US is now not only looking to send $ aid to Ukraine but Israel too
[2023-10-20 19:48:06] <breeze.dev> more debt more printing higher cost of items
[2023-10-20 19:48:17] <breeze.dev> (not financial advice information for mevucational purposes only)
[2023-10-20 19:48:54] <breeze.dev> (should also note that just because the DXY goes up doesn't exactly mean dollars are rising in value it could be that other world currencies are falling faster than dollars and vice versa)
[2023-10-20 19:50:19] <shunshow> Nerds talking wen lambo
[2023-10-20 19:56:32] <breeze.dev> the only way to get a lambo is to fail as a cryptocurrency developer and start an influencer personality + company/LLC
[2023-10-20 19:56:38] <breeze.dev> and buy the lambo on company credit as a company car/asset to show everyone you made it and lure in more fans
[2023-10-20 19:56:52] <breeze.dev> because if you succeed as a cryptocurrency developer you won't even want the lambo because you don't want the wrench

[2023-10-21 19:27:38] <yannickcrypto> amazon arb not started yet but i know it will work 100%
[2023-10-21 19:28:04] <yannickcrypto> 90% of amazon arbs do this as a part time job beside their fulltime job
[2023-10-21 19:28:08] <yannickcrypto> they all low iq
[2023-10-21 19:28:14] <yannickcrypto> how they stand against a GOAT?
[2023-10-21 19:28:16] <yannickcrypto> HOW?
[2023-10-21 19:29:03] <stalkopat> Could be that it doesn't scale tbf
[2023-10-21 19:29:08] <yannickcrypto> it does scale
[2023-10-21 19:31:28] <yannickcrypto> well you dont get rich from it
[2023-10-21 19:31:35] <yannickcrypto> its nothing that will print you millions
[2023-10-21 19:34:23] <yannickcrypto> other mev bots arbed it for 60 eth total profit ig
[2023-10-21 19:34:47] <yannickcrypto> in same block
[2023-10-21 19:34:53] <stalkopat> 40 ETH in next block
[2023-10-21 19:35:00] <stalkopat> only like 15 was extracted in that block

[2023-10-21 19:37:43] <yannickcrypto> when northkorea setup malicious builder?
[2023-10-21 19:38:44] <ripostex> Didn't realize 0xf7 was under 0xe8's control most of the 500+ weth ended up there
[2023-10-21 19:39:29] <yannickcrypto> looks like a workaround because they dont (or cant?) update the main contract?
[2023-10-21 19:40:27] <stalkopat> its easy stop loss too
[2023-10-21 19:40:50] <stalkopat> if reorg happens / you get cucked funds are stuck in wrong contract so you can't lose any more $
[2023-10-21 19:41:18] <yannickcrypto> huh?
[2023-10-21 19:44:54] <yannickcrypto> validators? last year?

[2023-10-21 19:52:49] <yannickcrypto> 56.5 eth loss for a 2.5 eth profit opportunity where they keep 0.1 eth profit
[2023-10-21 19:56:13] <ripostex> at least they still dicked over the swapooooooors

[2023-10-21 22:09:26] <degencomedian> https://tenor.com/view/wtfgifgif26042600
[2023-10-21 22:11:48] <degencomedian> this is why you should use full disk encryption when running some bots in datacenters that store your private keys or at least not load them on disk but only in mem.
[2023-10-21 22:17:17] <degencomedian> there are some corrupt systemadmins in every datacenter
[2023-10-21 22:20:54] <_yascha> Mev paranoia runs deep

[2023-10-21 22:24:36] <curiousrabbit> how much of that security is now gone by describing it lol
[2023-10-21 22:25:41] <_yascha> Honestly i bet if you lined up 4 non profitable arb bots and 1 top arb bot most people couldn't tell the difference
[2023-10-21 22:26:20] <_yascha> Like showed them to people
[2023-10-21 22:27:00] <ripostex> Hax me already!
[2023-10-21 22:29:52] <curiousrabbit> easiest way to tell would be to look at the miner payment % 
[2023-10-21 22:30:00] <curiousrabbit> anyone paying 99% is not profitable
[2023-10-21 22:32:10] <_yascha> Omg lol
[2023-10-21 22:32:18] <_yascha> Lmao

[2023-10-21 22:49:31] <breeze.dev> i thought we had these convos already
[2023-10-21 22:50:49] <ripostex> And lose out on that precious 1% block share?!
[2023-10-21 22:51:15] <breeze.dev> that vs 57eth
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2023-10-21 20:23:03] <george_999> hi is there libraries to access flashbotProvider from java or c#?
[2023-10-21 20:31:14] <george_999> thanks i will build mine then
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2023-10-21 21:46:26] <ripostex> Lol they responded: https://twitter.com/gmbitco/status/1715724184150532325
[2023-10-21 22:21:21] <_yascha> I just put my p keys in an env var encrypted pass it in as a param decrypt on startup call it a day
[2023-10-21 22:26:11] <curiousrabbit> lined up what? key mgmt practices?
[2023-10-21 22:26:41] <ripostex> Plaintext in code baby!
[2023-10-21 22:40:31] <lebotflasher_96454> Wazaaaap!I just noticed that the hashes of the signals used on mevs shown on eigenphi are not showing upon my local public and private (mev share) mempool subscriptions.Where are these bots getting their signals from ?
[2023-10-21 22:49:38] <breeze.dev> the number of trusted builders &lt; 4
[2023-10-21 22:55:30] <degencomedian> as i have understood it they needed to reboot the system using a rescue iso to replace the certificate but can be wrong
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2023-10-21 22:49:27] <breeze.dev> why would someone send to a builder such as this anyway
[2023-10-21 23:11:48] <lebotflasher_96454> @pedro01 send me your fax number so that I can get some signals plx 
[2023-10-22 02:48:31] <wjmelements> It will be less after I stop sending them bundles
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2023-10-21 23:32:51] <erayack> Is there an announced amount for buying?https://twitter.com/specialmech/status/1712897837631947033?s=46&amp;t=HeLdxx2ALGlL0lpHyPvUFQ
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2023-10-22 05:59:15] <yannickcrypto> uhm when im a malicious data center employee and i want to drain bots then i would dump your MEM and haxx you
[2023-10-22 05:59:29] <yannickcrypto> enjoy encrypting your stuff
[2023-10-22 05:59:33] <yannickcrypto> im coming fren
[2023-10-22 06:01:31] <yannickcrypto> https://vxtwitter.com/gmbitco/status/1715746919861928039
[2023-10-22 06:01:35] <yannickcrypto> btw its not what happend there
[2023-10-22 06:01:44] <yannickcrypto> but im confident they will find the bug (other builders did already found their bug)
[2023-10-22 06:02:10] <seesoftware> what bug?
[2023-10-22 06:02:17] <ripostex> Why you say that?
[2023-10-22 06:02:19] <yannickcrypto> https://tenor.com/view/dogsmileshyboossmilegif24233810
[2023-10-22 06:02:25] <seesoftware> simulation related?
[2023-10-22 06:02:40] <yannickcrypto> they merge bundles if its not competive enough
[2023-10-22 06:03:10] <yannickcrypto> there is a second bundle in the sandwichbundle that invalidated the last leg of the sandwich
[2023-10-22 06:03:36] <ripostex> Find it hard to believe they wouldn't check
[2023-10-22 06:03:46] <ripostex> Their explanation seems more plausible
[2023-10-22 06:04:09] <yannickcrypto> that chaniging coinbase lead to revert?
[2023-10-22 06:04:10] <ripostex> Why you say they're wrong?
[2023-10-22 06:04:26] <ripostex> They explained  coinbase is a contract
[2023-10-22 06:04:58] <ripostex> So extra gas caused the sell to revert
[2023-10-22 06:05:35] <yannickcrypto> urgh
[2023-10-22 06:05:52] <yannickcrypto> then the builder told me bullshit
[2023-10-22 06:05:54] <yannickcrypto> you right
[2023-10-22 06:06:18] <yannickcrypto> he call coinbase with 2300 gas
[2023-10-22 06:06:58] <yannickcrypto> still hard to believe they dont check after changing coinbase lol
[2023-10-22 06:07:31] <seesoftware> why they even change coinbase?
[2023-10-22 06:07:39] <ripostex> Sure but it's a little more defensible  at first glance you'd think it wouldn't change anything
[2023-10-22 06:07:45] <yannickcrypto> to save the transfer at the end of block
[2023-10-22 06:07:57] <yannickcrypto> true
[2023-10-22 06:08:05] <ripostex> Why do they even care about winning if they keep nothing?
[2023-10-22 06:08:12] <yannickcrypto> flex
[2023-10-22 06:08:20] <ripostex> Is it all just for block share bragging rights?
[2023-10-22 06:08:37] <ripostex> Brb setting bribes to 100
[2023-10-22 06:08:48] <yannickcrypto> univ2 sandwich bribes already 100%
[2023-10-22 06:11:11] <ripostex> Landed a manual arb today so no need to despair yet!
[2023-10-22 06:11:28] <yannickcrypto> few days ago i arbed a nft reedem
[2023-10-22 06:11:30] <yannickcrypto> manual!
[2023-10-22 06:11:34] <ripostex> Saw that
[2023-10-22 06:11:52] <ripostex> Somehow way more rewarding than bot
[2023-10-22 06:12:32] <yannickcrypto> i tried to trick a token that have a function to liquidate other holders when they have more than 1% token supply balance
[2023-10-22 06:12:33] <yannickcrypto> failed
[2023-10-22 06:12:57] <ripostex> Liquidate the univ2 pool!
[2023-10-22 06:13:13] <yannickcrypto> excluded
[2023-10-22 06:13:39] <yannickcrypto> wrote a contract that empties the pool then send to top holder amounts until liquidation
[2023-10-22 06:14:20] <ripostex> Y no work? Also how do you profit?
[2023-10-22 06:15:27] <yannickcrypto> at liquidation you get 5% and other holder 95%
[2023-10-22 06:15:53] <yannickcrypto> since you own 25% of supply you get most of the 95% + 5% direct into your wallet
[2023-10-22 06:16:20] <ripostex> What a dumb mechanic
[2023-10-22 06:16:29] <yannickcrypto> oh ya
[2023-10-22 06:16:42] <yannickcrypto> my test contract ended with 30 eth that landed in the pool liq lol

[2023-10-22 06:18:15] <yannickcrypto> wos dis
[2023-10-22 06:18:27] <ripostex> Dunno bio says FB
[2023-10-22 06:18:34] <ripostex> What we miss?
[2023-10-22 06:18:45] <.sheero> why would he run out of gas for a 2300 transfer?
[2023-10-22 06:18:45] <yannickcrypto> https://tenor.com/view/dogsweatwipegif11284331
[2023-10-22 06:18:53] <yannickcrypto> coinbase was a contract
[2023-10-22 06:19:28] <.sheero> so is coinbase.transfer a bad way to do it
[2023-10-22 06:19:31] <yannickcrypto> coincidence?
[2023-10-22 06:19:50] <yannickcrypto> ya
[2023-10-22 06:19:54] <.sheero> :&lt;
[2023-10-22 06:20:48] <yannickcrypto> @Quintus gib some alpha

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2023-10-22 08:11:43] <mteam88> anyone know how protect rpc transactions are simulated?
[2023-10-22 08:16:42] <mteam88> &gt; No failed transactions: your transaction will only be included if it doesn't include any reverts so you don't pay for failed transactions.https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbotsprotect/quickstart
[2023-10-22 08:16:53] <mteam88> specifically how does that work?
[2023-10-22 08:17:37] <mteam88> if anyone on the flashbots team knows that would be great
[2023-10-22 08:17:38] <mteam88> (:
[2023-10-22 08:21:01] <ripostex> Would assume they sim them while building a block?
[2023-10-22 08:30:01] <mteam88> yeah thats what I thought
[2023-10-22 08:30:24] <mteam88> but I'm sending things that should not revert but aren't included
[2023-10-22 08:30:58] <mteam88> no I'm not simulating
[2023-10-22 08:31:12] <mteam88> big brain
[2023-10-22 08:31:18] <mteam88> can't tell you sorry
[2023-10-22 08:31:30] <mteam88> but we have acheived successful execution internally
[2023-10-22 08:31:37] <yannickcrypto> https://tenor.com/view/%E6%88%91%E9%82%84%E8%83%BD%E5%A0%85%E6%8C%81%E4%B8%80%E6%9C%83tiredsleepyfunnyanimalssadcatgif14663456
[2023-10-22 08:32:29] <stalkopat> https://twitter.com/MaxResnick1/status/1707509307598913961
[2023-10-22 08:32:53] <mteam88> its not funny if you explain it
[2023-10-22 08:33:01] <mteam88> it wasnt funny anyway so I'm not mad
[2023-10-22 08:34:24] <mteam88> idk I'll keep working at it
[2023-10-22 08:35:06] <mteam88> basically these transactions have a very low chance of not reverting
[2023-10-22 08:35:17] <mteam88> So I'm using protect rpc to not include reverting txs
[2023-10-22 08:35:20] <mteam88> to save on gas
[2023-10-22 08:35:32] <mteam88> but some of them should have been successful
[2023-10-22 08:35:50] <mteam88> but only in specific blocks
[2023-10-22 08:43:34] <yannickcrypto> Share your alpha with us you will feel better talking about it
[2023-10-22 08:46:51] <_yascha> Just sim it you have ages on mainnet
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2023-10-22 08:29:46] <yannickcrypto> as any other? :S
[2023-10-22 08:30:40] <yannickcrypto> you simulate on top of block?
[2023-10-22 08:31:07] <yannickcrypto> how u know it should not revert sir
[2023-10-22 08:42:08] <yannickcrypto> mteam printing big?
[2023-10-22 08:47:21] <_yascha> Could literally ffi sim and have time left
[2023-10-22 08:54:29] <mteam88> I wish
[2023-10-22 08:54:53] <mteam88> Not yet 
[2023-10-22 08:55:18] <mteam88> I'll leak if I can't figure out
[2023-10-22 08:56:03] <yannickcrypto> Yippie
[2023-10-22 09:26:16] <araka8765> I dont want to bribe like 99% anymore
