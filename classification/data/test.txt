I help in uniswap and the user came in stating that there was a bug in the contract and needed to pull the LQ. I looked at the contract and yes as you saw the burn function was left external and unprotected with no msg.sender. After Verifying that the user was the owner of the token. I did try to pull and I was hurrying after seeing the open function knowing a blackhat could do and it would be lost. Unfortunately i've never used or setup scripts for flashbots So I did unexpectedly get beat by that mev bot as you saw . It is very embarrassing and I feel shity. Wish I hadn't even seen it tbh. And just fyi I don't have a contract with 400eth I had told the user that I've helped recover over 400eth the money did go through a dex so that wallet is not mine most likely the dexs wallet. I'm curious how one uses that email from the bot?
